    "## Case study 7.1 - Classifying automative reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "This notebook walks through the use of NLP to analyse customer sentiment. It forms the basis of Case Study 1 in Module 7 and is referenced in multiple exercises throughout the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the case study is to identify 'complaints' from a sample of YELP reviews for automotive companies. YELP is a North American review service where customers review different service providers. Reviewers write a text review and are then asked to rate the service on a five point scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### References:\n",
    "The dataset that is used in this case study was sourced from a Kaggle competition in which YELP provided a set of reviews: https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "It contains information about businesses across 8 metropolitan areas in the USA and Canada.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this case study, the dataset has been refined to contain 50,000 reviews for companies tagged as 'automotive'."

Paid my $41.00 and was given back my car just over an hour later.\\nToday I had to go to work (40 mile round trip commute).  As I was getting off of I-85, I noticed the smell of burning oil.  I thought maybe the tech just spilled a little on the exhaust manifold since it's right there, and maybe it's burning off.  I didn't hit a stop light until I was almost at my office.  When I stopped and was waiting for the light, my cabin started to fill with smoke, and I had smoke pouring out from under the hood and the wheel wells as well.\\nI pulled over into the parking area of a gas station (because they have accessible fire extinguishers) and parked.  I popped the hood only to find THE TECHNICIAN DID NOT PUT THE OIL FILLER CAP BACK ON!!!  Now my engine is covered in potentially flammable oil, and of course Huntersville Ford is closed today!!!!\\nI have my car sitting outside in the parking lot with the hood open, just in case it decides to ignite, because my engine is pretty hot after a 20 mile drive.\\nI called and left a voicemail, and now I have to find a way to degrease my engine at work, just so I can drive it home in a less-flammable state.  I WILL HOLD HUNTERSVILLE FORD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COMPONENTS THAT FAIL AS OF A RESULT OF THIS.  Most electronics don't like being slathered in motor oil.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they aren't designed for that.\\n\\nAnd NO, I did not have other work done... Just the oil change.  You had 1 job.... oil change.  No transmission service, no brake service, no rotation, no cooling flush... just an oil change.  I hope he remembered to tighten the filter, but I am skeptical at this point.\\n\\nI can assure you, I will NOT be taking my car back to that dealership, even though it is right around the corner from my house.  MAKE IT RIGHT, HUNTERSVILLE FORD.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Actually my name is Aaron Sloan. My ex-wife was Erin S. Just clarifying so they know exactly who posted this. I have spent over 1000 dollars and still not finished from 6+k in damages from the estimate on my car that I left there on a Wednesday afternoon and Geico estimated 15 days to repair it and then was told it was done the next Tues.morning. Corners cut? Anyone with half of a brain would agree. I asked where's my new rim damaged in the accident? Oh sorry here is another Geico adjuster present standing next to my car. Owner says my adjuster Tom Fletcher is an asshole and that the guy present standing next to my car was fair and he said he would get me a rim. And the owner also promised the rim regardless and when I asked how much more to do some touch up paint work he said FREE! Long as I would bring my business to them, from now on. \\n     He surely noticed that my inspection was up soon as he promised me BOTH! Then I NEVER heard another word from them again since Dec.2016. And still have not been able to afford to fix all of the damage done in the accident that they overlooked due to quick in and out. I had to buy a new battery 3 days later when my car wouldn't start. Whatever mechanic worked on my car forgot to plug in the power cord to my new radiator cooling fan and my car overheated and had to spend money to get a diagnosis why it was overheating and was a simple wire not plugged in. So also proof it was never even tested to see if the new fan worked . This was a front end collision and then I had and still have a loud clicking sound coming from my front wheel where the rim wasn't replaced.  When I took it elsewhere for inspection soon after due to no reply from multiple messages left for the owner gone without a reply? Rather than bother with them after speaking with an ex-employee, I realized I was screwed.  So then I had a broken tie rod not noticed or added to my estimate and anyone knows you need an alignment when you replace a tie rod so another 300 bucks total. \\n    But still have the clicking noise or loud tapping and my friend said it's either The CV joint or a bent control arm. But couldn't tell without it on a lift . So now will end up spending a fortune to finally get my car back to perfect operating condition like it was before one of their tow truck drivers just happened to be standing there in downtown Pittsburgh during rush hour with a walkie.  Waiting to prey on me. But I still haven't gotten to the most corrupt part.  Geico paid them from my estimate to recharge my A.C. since it was obvious that it was routine when my radiator, cooling fan, and coolant tank were all destroyed. But guess what happened when I went to actually USE my A.C. a couple months later once winter broke? Hot air. So I took it to Ryan's Auto/Goodyear in Moon. Twp., and explained everything to them. They said well I can't imagine they would have not recharged your system with refrigerant.  So I paid for a diagnosis and dye ran thru the system and nice of them to only charge me 75 bucks and guess what? Cold air!!! NO LEAKS! SO THEY NEVER EVEN RECHARGED MY A.C. Crooks! And guess what else ? I AM AN UBER DRIVER FOR 2PLUS YEARS NOW AND UBER HAS THEIR TEST TRACK BLOCKS AWAY FROM THIS SHOP IN HAZELWOOD JUST BEHIND THE RAILROAD TRACKS! I have driven Uber employees there too many times to count and as well as them? I tell ALL of my riders to NEVER take their car here no matter what.\",\n",

They said as soon as the cabin air filter was taken out the ac worked beautifully! So great you found nothing wrong with the ac just do the filter and other things! Well less than 24 hours later low and behold the ac started to malfunction... Again! We take it back to check it again and get told they never checked the rest of the ac system and now we have to buy a $300 blower motor and that is before labor! We had spent every penny we had already on the other work because we trusted that the tech did his job. Boy were we wrong. Now here we are an uber driver who now can't work because it's 115 degrees out and his ac only works sometimes. How do we pay our bills? No help, no caring, no claimed responsibility on their part and we are left with nothing. Thanks for destroying us!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I purchased my first vehicle from Pinnacle Nissan. My Nissan Juke was very good to me so I decided I want to stay with Nissan. My first experience was great with the first vehicle. \\n\\nI've been looking around at the new Nissan Murano. I recently visited Avondale Nissan just to test drive and discuss costs. The people there were very rude and turned me off on buying a new car any time soon. \\n\\nThe other day I received a personal text from Bryson asking if I was in the market to buy a new car, which I have been. I told him what I wanted over text and about my Juke and finances. He was able to write up a deal and call me with the info which made the process easy! Saved so much time that could have been wasted at the dealership if the numbers didn't come out right. And they got my interest rate at 3.24 when Avondale Nissan was trying to give me 7% which is higher than the rate of my first car when I had zero credit. My credit  is in the 700's so there is no way I should have been ripped off at 7% like Avondale Nissan tried. \\n\\nI was offered a trade in value of $9700 at the other dealership. At pinnacle they gave me $12000 which significantly more and paid off my previous loan; even giving me some extra towards the price of my new Murano. \\n\\nI was impressed by my experience. John in financing was fantastic and very good at explaining the process. Bryson was also very helpful in making the process as easy as possible. \\n\\nI'm picky and the Murano i wanted wasn't available in Arizona so they found it in Nevada and had it shipped. I was told about 4 days and put into a loaner Murano. My new Murano came in a day in a half and is exactly what I wanted. \\n\\nI appreciate the professionalism of the staff here.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"This last year, I finally saved up for the down payment on a car. I needed one very badly, having been using a relative's vehicle for several months, but that they now needed back. I had planned ahead and done my research, and wanted a Ford CMax Hybrid. My work offered a discount/cash-back deal through Cars.com, so I submitted the request and my info was sent to Berge. My plan was to take advantage of the 4th of July weekend specials.\\n\\nI was almost immediately sent an email from a salesman named Chris. He wanted to know what I was looking for in a vehicle. I replied right away with the details... But the only email address given was a generic one, nothing direct. There was no response. A few days later, he sent me another email, this time with a map to the dealership, but with no indication my reply was received. I replied back, asking for some quotes, but again got no response. I was anxious with the impending July 4th weekend, but held hope I could still make contact. I decided to call. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the only number he gave me was his personal cell. That Friday after work, I called and was immediately sent to voicemail. I got a text saying he was at dinner, but would return my call. I left a voicemail explaining that I badly needed a car, either from him or someone else at the dealership, and that he hasn't actually replied to my emails (maybe he forgot to check the general inbox?) and I asked him to call me  back ASAP. I really needed the July 4th specials. \\n\\nThe weekend came and went, no reply from Chris. Frustrated, I went to a different dealership in Scottsdale and worked with wonderful people, and that next weekend negotiated a deal on a beautiful CMax that made up for missing out on both the holiday weekend deals and the cash-back deal through my work. TWO WEEKS LATER Chris emails me to say their servers were out of commission, which is why he didn't get my emails, and he would love to help me into a car (this all being said in poor spelling and no caps or punctuation ).\\n\\nMy brother was a car salesman for awhile, so I have a pretty good idea how it goes. I was only given his personal cell number so he could make sure he got my sale instead of anyone else. I'm also an IT student, so I have a very hard time believing their servers were down for two whole weeks. Either they have the worst tech support in the history of ever, or I was put off so I wouldn't have to be offered a holiday deal. Plus, what, did you not check your voicemail?? \\n\\nMy experience here was beyond unprofessional. I'm glad, now, that I went where I did for my car. Berge only saw my business as a number. I will never shop with them.\",\n",

Was helped by Benjamin (name on the work order) who was great.  Told us they would check the tire and rotate them for free.  Went outside to look at the tire and measure the remaining thread on each tire (still OK).  They did find a nail and fixed it.  I will return here when I need a new set of tires.  Discount Tire must train their employees well as I've always received excellent service.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'So here I am AGAIN.\\n\\nWhy again do you ask? I just purchased a 2011 Chevrolet Malibu from this dealership, and I went here after work to pick up the green slip so I can register the car with the DMV. \\nTIP: Customers who buy or lease vehicles here: DO NOT have to go to the DMV to register your vehicle. You simply use the dealerships control number on the green slip to enter in the DMV website and it will bring up the vehicle you bought. You can then transfer or request new plates (standard only plates) and the DMV will mail them to you. This is handy, because we ALL hate the DMV. \\n\\nBack to my review of AutoNation Buick GMC of West Sahara round 2. So I got the green slip and I was \"just looking\" at some of the Buicks on the lot. Buick has come along way in the last 10 years or so. This is NOT your grandfather\\'s or grandmother\\'s Buick anymore. I had a 2013 LEXUS ES 300h that got 39MPG highway and 40MPG city. It had quite a few bells and wistles. Anyway, I began by driving a V6 powered 2016 Buick Lacrosse and Devon and Denzell were my points of contact again. I really liked it. This one didn\\'t have the same equipment that my Lexus does, so I didn\\'t really want this particular car, as I didn\\'t want to go down in car quality or caliber. Then I drove a 2014 Chevrolet Impala V6, and loaded with everything for that model year with 22k miles and they were asking 25k for it. I really liked this car. It wasn\\'t a Lexus or a Buick, but it was cheaper than either one of those and it was fully loaded. But I was contemplating replacing my business car, which was my Lexus, and I already had a V6 powered Malibu that I bought for 16k with 32.5k miles two weeks earlier from this same dealership, and the same sales people (Devin and Denzell). It took me forever to decide even after driving a brand new 2015 Buick Lacrosse that had just about everything my Lexus did minus the front parking sensors and the dash cam, but I can replace the dash cam later (which I will at this dealership for both my Malibu and Lacrosse). I got a Heads Up display system with forward collision alert, I got a Bose audio system, a panoramic sun roof, remote starter system, and a wifi hotspot powered by onstar. These features my Lexus didn\\'t have. \\n\\nI was given multiple options, and a lot of time to decide which vehicle I wanted out of the three, the Chevrolet Impala, or the 2015 V4 eAssist Buick or the 2016 V6 Buick. I ultimately chose the 2015 eAssist V4 Buick Lacrosse based upon what I was going to be doing with the car, showing Real Estate. I was offered an unbelieveable deal too. Because this vehicle was a 2015, and was sitting in the showroom, and the 2016\\'s were already here and more were coming, this car was priced at 35k. Originally it was 41k which was understandable. If I bought my Lexus ES 300h brand new, it would have been 47k easy. I know cars, and how to shop for the ones I like or want. So I knew I was getting a deal on this new car. Also, I was given a 2k tax credit for my Lexus, and AutoNation gave me another $800.00 off on the car, because I am a repeat buyer, and I didn\\'t waste anyone\\'s time. Thank you David! \\n\\nSo I still had 1k of negative equity to deal with, and that was done by lowering my interest rate from 4.9% with Lexus to 3.9% through AutoNation Buick GMC\\'s contacts. Can you say Credit Unions anyone? If you want great financing go see the fine people at AutoNation Buick GMC, they WILL find you a good deal, if it takes all day. They don\\'t just use traditional banks or manufacturer banks like most dealerships do, which all charge higher interest rates, trust me I\\'ve been there. \\n\\nSo in combination of lowering the interest rate again to 3.45%, and further dropping the price of the new 2015 Buick Lacrosse, I wrapped up my negative equity and came UP about 2k. This shows in the contract as down payment money which is true because I verified how the dealership got the numbers. So I got a brand new Buick Lacrosse, with an extended warranty, prepaid oil changes for 3 years on top of the 2 years given to you by GM (General Motors), theft protection and GAP insurance and my payments are $616.00 per month versus $647.00 a month with Lexus without the theft protection, or the prepaid maintance plans. Lexus doesn\\'t offer standard oil changes for the first 2 years either. \\n\\nWhat\\'s more, my Buicks engine, transmission, and final point of assembly are in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Just like my 2011 Chevrolet Malibu. The major components of these cars are made here. Just read the window sticker, it will tell you where the major components are made. We need jobs in this country badly. I don\\'t need Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump to \"bring back the jobs\" to the United States. We can all do our part by giving GM, Ford or even Fiat Chrysler a chance. Personally, I am a GM man. I loved my Lexus, but I love my country, my Buick, and the sales team at AutoNation Buick GMC even more. They also hire the veterans! Thank you again everyone @ AutoNation!',\n",

I suspected a likely fuel leak somewhere near the firewall but could not locate one.   I took my car to Ganley  Lincoln Service Dept. and paid the $129 diagnostic fee (steep!).  Service advisor Beth P called to inform that I needed $1900 in repairs as the exhaust manifold gaskets were leaking and had a bad seal. Yikes!!   Keep in mind this is a 2007 Lincoln Town Town in meticulous condition, always garaged, and only 65,000 miles and has barely been driving in winter.\\n\\n I was quoted $500 a side for new exhaust manifolds and bolts at another service facility.  However,  the mechanic of 20 years said he has never seen a town car or crown vic needing new exhaust manifolds at 65,000 miles.   He did some further research and discovered the left rear cylinder spark plug was not seated properly and only needed to be rethreaded.  Total cost was $75 for retap and INCLUDED his diagnostic time as well.   Problem was fixed!!!\\n\\nI know enough about engines as well to realize that $1900 sounded sky high and didn't think the new manifolds solution sounded correct.

(not shampooed, just the seated sprayed off and wiped) We were told to get the $39.00 VIP package, and it would take care of cleaning off the front and back seats. Not only did the wash on the outside look horrible, they barely wiped down the front seats, doors, and dash, they also didnt wipe anything in the back. I had to argue with the manager for almost 10 minutes about wiping down the back, that took him a whole 2 minutes to do, and it was still so half-assed that I had to do it myself once I took the car home. We paid $39 for what would have been the same wash as the $7 was.\\n\\nI had then taken my car in for detail since I had received a detail job certificate from a friend a couple weeks prior to this fiasco, and being there are no refunds on detail jobs, I had to take it in or lose the money. So, this past weekend, it went in. They took 5 hours to detail the car. I was expecting it to take between 3-4 like they had originally told me, but, that was just the start of the frustration. I paid to have the car detailed with a clay bar to remove swirl marks and find scratches. There are now more swirl marks on my car than when it went in, not all of the wax was removed, so I had to use my microfiber cloths to remove it myself, I specifically said that I DIDNT want any armorall or leather conditioner on my interior, and to just clay bar the outside, they didnt listen to that, so I spent 30 minutes wiping greasy armorall off my interior and leather. I told the manager that I was completely dissatisfied with the job that was done, he refused to give me any money back and said I would have to bring it back for them to do the job again. I will NOT take my car back to have more damage done for another 5 hour job. I could have purchased the stuff to do the job myself in about 2 hours of time and had it done right.\\n\\nPlease head this warning and DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE! terrible wash, and even worse customer service.',\n",

The dealer was nice and seemed well kept, the people were friendly and didn\\'t feel attacked when we pulled up. We had an appointment with a salesman who was actually great and a pleasure to speak with until his manager got involved. I\\'ve purchased/sold more cars than I\\'ve ever wanted to so I knew where I wanted to be with my trade in and where I wanted to be on the new purchase based on the current sales and rebates. The manager came in about $1000 lower than where I wanted on the trade which wasn\\'t a deal breaker until he told us the price of the new truck. It was a few thousand higher than I had figured based on the incentives and I told him that I\\'ve already gotten better pricing in writing from other dealers but they were a little further away drive time. He said \"they\\'re not going to honor that price but go ahead and try, you\\'ll be back when they don\\'t\". Let me just tell you that speaking this way to my wife and I assures we wont be back and we did end up saving almost $2000 buying elsewhere. This likely could have been a positive experience but this managers arrogance cost him and the dealer not only the sale but any/all future service\\'s and referrals.',\n",

All the while the person is changing your oil, they pull other parts out of the car (air filter, etc) and ask that you get them replaced, even if they\\'ve been replaced somewhere else. When I told them I got the part fixed before, they asked \"where\" in an almost confronting manner, as if they never believed it was done. Some of the service was done by them only months prior, and they acted as if they couldn\\'t find it within their computers. Shouldn\\'t be that hard, if whenever I decline their service that they offer me besides the oil change, they remind me the next time that I declined them the last time. I argued with the last serviceman the last time I took my jeep in for a good 15 minutes about transmission flushes. \\n\\nStick to your guns while going here. If all you need is an oil+filter change, tell them that when you go there. Tell them that you are not interested in anything else, or that you do other maintenance measures yourself. Oil changes don\\'t cost much, but when the salesy pitch is pulled out, you may end up spending an upwards of 300$ on something you don\\'t really need!',\n",

I don't like to feel pressured and obligated to buy from a sales person, especially in regards to something as big as a new car, and would rather bow out than give in.

If it hadn't been for Macon and her partner in crime, Alex Woodford, it may not have happened.  Those two were so awesome, patient and understanding about how I needed time to review the information and consider everything before making the final decision.  Between my hesitation and thorough research, I ended up delaying the process for about over a week or more, but because of their patience and just awesomeness all around, we walked out with a better car than I had even expected in the end.\\n\\n   Again, Macon Wild is the person to see at Enterprise Car Sales in Las Vegas.

I spoke with the Supervisor for body work and he couldn't even believe it got through quality control the way it was, twice. He offered me a free detail which were taking them up on.

The other companies told me I had to schedule an appointment just to get a quote. And those that did see me, told me I would be without my car for weeks! I called Fix Auto, and from the beginning Al was very kind and informative. He told me to bring it in anytime for a quote. I brought it in hours later and after Al explained what needed to be done and how long it would take , I booked my appointment. While the other companies were telling me it would take weeks, Al said he would have my car ready by the end of that week. Four days later and hours earlier than promised, my car was ready! Couldn't be happier. They did an excellent job and Al continuously kept me up-to-date on the status of my car. I highly recommend Fix Auto. Al even offered other services they do aside from bodywork. I will definitely be back to take care of any updates my car needs such as headlights windshield wiper replacement, etc....\\nA+++++ work & customer service !!!! \\nHappy customer\",\n",

They provided two numbers some beemer place that never returned my call and Richard's Auto Clinic.  Called Richard's and Lori was friendly and was way helpful, got an address and directions.  Headed over, got us in rapidly.  While we waited we're provided drinks and a comfortable waiting room.  Their customer service is top notch!!! Lori took time to help me figure out a different auto related issue!!  Very kind and thoughtful.  All said and done two loose hose clamps!  Thank God!  Invited us to friend them on Facebook and also asked we let them know when we make it home!  On top of that she let me know that if anything else happened to get the car back and they would get on it first thing Monday.  Let's hope that doesn't happen but having piece of mind that there are kind and thoughtful mechanics out there is outstanding!

It is bad enough that your vehicle gets towed but then to have to deal with an agency that is dishonest, rude, unscrupulous and participates in the behavior of cheating the public , makes the experience that much worse. \\nThis company has a $50 fee to have your car released on a day it is closed or after hours. However, they do not tell you that even AFTER you ask for options on how to pick up your vehicle. Instead, they hold your car for an additional 3 days and charge you $30 a day simply telling you that it's not their job to provide you with  truthful answers to the questions you've asked. Great job DV TOWING, robbing the public and generating gain on the back of this cities residents. I will be going a step further and reporting them. I've already forgiven them but I hope that they will experience financial consequences for their poor business practices. As a public we deserve to deal with trustworthy companies, no matter what their occupation. No wonder their ratings are so low!\",\n",

If there is a problem with the tires that isn\\'t typical, their customer service skills and professionalism weren\\'t apparent to me... \\n\\nI purchased a set of wheels and tires for my truck in July of 2011, have had a constant vibration at highway speeds since these were installed (until this past Wednesday, new tires from Firestone, they match prices too, go figure). Returning week after week (I work during the week, would go here on Saturdays) didn\\'t solve it, they\\'d re-balance, tell me they were going to torque the rims with the vehicle up in the air, tell me they would do a road force balancing, etc. then blame the truck!\\n\\nI have lifetime alignments on the truck, every 5k there is an oil change, alignment adjustment and rotate and balancing. Front end has been checked by Nissan, Firestone and yours truly.  I don\\'t think things have changed that much in the industry from 15 years ago where I would call the manufacturer of the tire and work out a pro-ration and exchange for a different type of tire (customer pays for tread used) when a tire just doesn\\'t work on a vehicle or someone isn\\'t satisfied with the tires.

They wouldn\\'t measure the center that was showing wear bars. I leave... 2 weeks later, have the truck at Firestone for her alignment and oil change, they measure the rear tires at 4/32nds and find a nail in a sidewall of one of them. OK, 4/32nds at FS, 6/32nds at DT, let\\'s go use my replacement certificate. Of course, when measuring for a road hazard replacement, they only measure the center which is at 2/32nds.

After a little over an hour Keith called me and stated that, yes my battery failed and that it was replaced under warranty.  I am like cool but then he showed me the multi point inspection sheet that my front brakes were at 3 and 2 mm and my rear brakes were at 7mm.  He said it would cost 329.00 to replace the front brakes but I had my kids so I told him I couldn\\'t at that time but will comeback in a few days.  So I left and went home and told the wife the outcome.  She then stated \" weren\\'t the brakes at 8 or 7 the last time it was there?  I was like yea your right, so I went and took out the invoice and looked on the inspection sheet and yes it stated my front brakes were at 7mm(Green) and rear at 5mm(Yellow).  That was on 18 Jan 16 and my mileage was at 28,500. So within a month and half, 1,200 miles later my front brakes went from 7mm to 2mm and rear brakes went from 5mm back to 7mm.  WOW...I bought this van in Las Vegas in May of 2014.  We moved in June of 2015 to Pennsylvania and drove the van.  So from May 2014 to Jan 2016 and 5 to 28,500 miles my front brakes went from 10mm to 7mm and rear brakes went from 10mm to 5mm which sounds about right.  So doing the math, that\\'s the front brakes losing 3mm and rear brakes losing 5mm.  Now from 18 Jan 16 to 2 Mar 16 and 28,500 to 29,700 miles my front brakes went from 7mm to 2mm and my rear brakes went from 5mm to 7mm, so again doing the math my front brakes lost 5mm and rear brakes gained 2mm.  So just under 2 years I lost 3mm, then under 1.5 months I lost 5mm...I don\\'t think so.  They obviously tried to scam me into getting front brakes when I don\\'t really need them and I would have got them if it wasn\\'t for my kids being with me at the time.  Either the techs don\\'t know what they are doing or this is a scam...I bet on that it is a scam...stay away from them....',\n",

After my check engine light came on in my Lexus IS300, I was praying it was just a bad O2 sensor but quickly learned that the catalytic converter needed to be replaced. After a dealer quote of $4000 (which is more than I paid for the car), I went down to 5 Star Auto to get a quick estimate. \\n\\nNot only was I impressed with the price Mike was able to work out for me, I was thrilled to be able to schedule an appointment for the following monday (3 days after I came in...including weekend days). True to his word, Mike had my IS done on time and even went the extra mile to clean my lifetime air filter. The car runs like a dream, and I couldn't be happier! Wish I could keep these guys a secret but that would truly be a disservice to the community. Thanks, again, Mike and the rest of the team at 5 Star Auto! You guys rock!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Walked in and knew exactly which car we wanted. Did a very short test drive and we agreed on the internet advertised price. The next morning I was looking at the paper work and noticed the base price had gone up over $1600. I called to ask about it and the guy asked me if I was looking at the total after taxes etc.  Ok. I don't know how stupid he thought I was but of course not!  I was looking at the base starting price!  After going in to the dealership to pursue this it was pointed out that the advertised price does not include mandatory dealer add on charges, such as window tinting (it was a used car and already on), nitrogen tires and other things that added up to over $1600. I guess it was on something I signed while getting to the desired monthly payment, but why wasn't it clearly pointed out?  And why dont I have any documentation or itemization of it in my loads of paperwork?  If I had in fact purchased these things I should have some sort of receipt for them. I think it's a horrible way to do business. We had verbally agreed on the advertised price and those add ons were glossed over and snuck in on top of that price. I have bought many used cars throughout my life and I have never ever run into this.  I will never again buy a car from a dealership who has mandatory dealer add ons.  If I see a price online I should not end up paying any more unless it is for optional items that are my choice.  Why would you even want to do business this way?  You've got a great line of quality cars. People will buy them. By looking at this site this same issue has made a lot of people really mad. You want people to feel like the got a great deal, not that they've been had. I gave two stars because most of the people there were actually pretty nice, but I still feel like that was a pretty slick move.\",\n",

This car wash, even at their highest priced wash, will give you a bare bones, decent wash so your car doesn't look like crap rolling down the street. We have been bringing both our vehicles here for about 2 years now, having bought the unlimited wash passes for both. My husband has a flat black dip job on his truck and it looks filthy after 2 days of normal driving. The $15/month pass is perfect- we can drive through and get it decently clean within a few minutes. I don't mind vacuuming myself or wiping down my own interior. The cars don't get spotlessly clean like they do at a handwash, but good enough for the price. My only issue is with the electronic pass for your windshield. It literally works properly 1/5 times. We were told this was due to a faulty pass and given a new one. Then we were told it was due to the polarized windshield, and they gave us a signed pass to keep in the glove compartment. We have problems each time we use it and are told that we need the adhered windshield pass. It take a 10 minute explanation each time until the manager comes out and recognizes us as near daily patrons. Otherwise, I think this place is a good bang for the buck!\",\n",

Here's our story. \\n\\nMy wife and son took our Edge in for a routine oil change and next thing I know they are given a recommendation that ranged in the thousands of dollars. The service advisor made it sound like it was urgent and we would be taking a risk if the work was not done. I took my car to a trusted mechanic and he said none of the recommended work needed to be done right away and some not for a long time. After hearing this, I felt like the service person was just trying to make money through scare tactics. I have bought 3 cars from this facility and have done service through them since then but now I will not bring my cars back again and I will not buy another car from them because I don't trust their ethics any longer! I understand the need to let the customers know what could potentially be wrong but they should also be honest and add when they really need to be fixed to give the full picture. The advisors I worked with early on were honest and did not try to up sale me on things that needed to be done through scare tactics but just let me know the facts and when they could be done. Unfortunately they do not work there anymore. I wonder why?\",\n",

I also love that they always carry every single last item on my grocery list, including the items on my 'Indian shopping list' such as basmati rice and chickpea flour. The produce section is always well stocked and it's rare that they run out of items before restocking them. The prices are always reasonable and they carry Joe Fresh clothing which I love to peruse!\\n\\nThe parking situation is also good and it's located in the Country Hills Plaza so you can pick up movie rentals, drop off your dry cleaning, pick up some pizza and even grab a couple of blizzards from Dairy Queen on your way home :)\\n\\nI've missed this Superstore in my years away and I'm planning to make up for lost time in the upcoming weeks :) \\n\\nSee you there.\",\n",

I wanted to get new break pads and rotors because my steering wheel shakes a bit when I brake from a high rate of speed and my car has 72,000 miles so I figured it was a good idea. They told me $250 and they could do it today. Well, they take my car back and then they come out and tell me that I need new drums because mine are warped and shocks and struts, yada yada...Suddenly it's a $1,400 job. I just had it at the dealer for a recall and they said they did an inspection and didn't mention any of this so I decide to wait and get a second opinion. So, I ask them to write all this down for me...Suddenly, the shocks and struts are mileage recommended, not because they've noticed anything wrong with them and the drums are just ''slightly'' warped. I'll be curious to see what the dealer says. It is so disheartening not to have a reliable place to take my car that doesn't just want to rip me off.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I had paid cash with a trade-in for a 2016 Chevrolet Corvette. This was the second oil change that I had scheduled. The scheduling was very easy, and I had asked that there be some extra time allotted as the digital display behind the odometer was not changing and I needed help with that. When I arrived, I was sent to the Customer Service and Bert Neal was the Consultant assigned to help me. First off, he told me that he couldn't have the digital display checked as there was not enough time allocated for it... this was after he couldn't figure out who was supposed to be assigned to help me, and it turned out to be him. I told him when I made the appointment 2 weeks earlier, I knew I would be back in Las Vegas and needed that looked at so I had asked for the time to be allotted when I made the appointment. He kept telling me he didn't know what I was talking about and so forth. Anyway, he said he'd look at the car and check it out after the oil change. He didn't have the faintest clue about the car or what I needed looked at and so his time spent there was a complete waste. Also, the oil change was done in about 10 minutes, but the car was brought back to me unwashed and not vacuumed out. I would have thought for a new car, there might be some perk when you're getting your recommended service, like at the Lexus dealership. There was none. Bert then got in the car and proceeded to tell me that the S, T, TR, W, E button was working and I informed him that wasn't even what I was talking about. He had zero clue. He finally took it to Concierge service where the nice young woman immediately showed me how to change the digital display. The last thing I asked was about the center console where your arm rests as the leather started to wrinkle after 6 months. I had asked about it and Bert immediately said it was my fault for using lotion and putting my arm on the arm rest and it wasn't under warranty. He said I could talk to the manager but that it wouldn't be covered. He did tell me I could take the car to St. George, UT, where I now live, but have never had the car for any service and see if they might cover it. I was like, 'why would a dealership, who didn't sell me the car, cover anything and why won't you take care of it here?' Honestly, I was so incredibly disappointed with Bert Neal. I spent 65K on a car that the salesman worked hard to ensure my sale went through well and then some lazy guy who is a sales consultant, could ruin the entire reputation of the Henderson dealership. I had to finally ask Bert if he was going to go get Roger, the Manager, or do I have too? He went to get Roger, and I can tell you, Bert wasn't happy about having to go get me any help. I'm thinking, I've spent a ton of money, I'm a good customer, why do I have to deal with some jerk who was talking condescending to me and treating me like I was an idiot, when he was the one who didn't have a clue what was going on? Roger came out and spoke with me. He was extremely pleasant and wanted to get things fixed. He did not agree with Bert on the lotion issue and informed me how to better take care of that issue. I will say that if I have to have service at the Henderson dealership, I will ask to NOT have Bert Neal work with me. His attitude toward having to look something up or move away from his desk was like I was a big inconvenience. It really does hurt your customer satisfaction to have an employee like that. Also, I would suggest that at the very least, a light vacuum be done of the cars which are in for service that is under warranty, like the Lexus dealership does. I do love the Corvette, but the service behind it has been minimal. Thank you. I feel bad giving a '1' star, but Bert was one of the worst customer service people I've ever dealt with. Roger and the girl from the Concierge were amazing so the '1' star is for the Sales Consultant Bert Neal. Otherwise, I would give the service for the oil change a 3 and Concierge and Management a 5 star.\\n\\nAn update to this review done on 8-28-2017:  I was able to get the car in for the part and Roger in Management helped with that process.  He was great to work with.  Steve was the new Sales Consultant I worked with and was amazing also. They got the car in, fixed and got me on my way quickly.  Thank you to the great people in management and scheduling, who helped to get this issue resolved for me.  I appreciate it so much.\",\n",

The staff are organized and the mechanics do good work, so I'm disappointed to say that I got taken for a ride.\\n\\nLong story short, due to ownership changes, I took the same car in for an inspection to get a safety certificate twice within a few months. Safety certs are a bit ridiculous because you're basically handing the shop a blank cheque -- no cert, no vehicle permit. For unscrupulous shops, the money isn't in the $100 cert, it's in 'finding' urgent items to repair.\\n\\nConveniently, both times, they found $800 of different repairs that were needed. I'm not sure they were aware that they had very recently looked at the exact same car. I know enough about cars to know that some was legit and would have been due within a few months anyways, but some was definitely not. Prime example: They told me the driver's seat bracket was badly rusted, causing it to have loosened and wobble against to the frame. I pulled out the flashlight and didn't see rust, but it did wobble, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. So a replacement seat was installed and I got my cert. Sure enough, it still wobbles. Zero difference, except that it I was $500 poorer, and apparently this invisible rust is gone. Such an insult.\\n\\nThis place is fine for a tire change, but if you're looking for a shop you can trust, I'm sorry to say that you'll need to keep looking.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I had over $2000 worth of work done on my car here 2 years ago.  Tint job, and car audio installation were the two major things I had worked on at this shop.  I have an older car with the dot matrix at the top of the back window for the defroster.  I don\\'t know much about tinting, so I didn\\'t know that it would like shit when trying to tint over the dot matrix.  I go to pickup my car that night, and was told by the owner - \"Don\\'t worry it just has to set, and then it won\\'t show any more.\"  I ask how long, and am told about a week.  A week goes by and it looks exactly the same.  I bring it back, and the story changes.  \"Oh, it\\'s the dot matrix at the top..it can\\'t be helped, that\\'s just the way it turns out.  I\\'ll have my installer use a heat gun, press it out and see if we can get it to look better.\"  It actually looks much worse after all is said and done.  I have no complaints about the tinting on the other windows....except.   When I originally went to pickup my car after the initial installation the owner was working on another car where the owner blamed him for the window getting jammed up and coming off track after getting his tint done.   Ironically my passenger side window went off track a week or so after getting work done here, and it scratched up my newly installed tint.  The owner said it wasn\\'t his fault, and they would not replace the tint.  \\n\\nNow to the car audio installation.  The installation looks clean.  I have had no problems with the way it looks.   However I was sold on having the steering wheel controller installed.  (controls the volume and FF/RW tracks on the steering wheel).  He was unable to get it to work, and instead of offering a refund (89.99) I was told it was my problem, and I had to go to the dealership to fix the steering wheel control?  So I\\'m out 89.99!  The original subwoofer that was installed, blew out after a year.  It has a year warranty, so I was able to get a replacement subwoofer at no charge - BUT he charged me $35 to cover the shipping cost of the subwoofer to his shop.  I ended up paying it...hoping that would be the last of it.  NOPE, 11 months later, the subwoofer blows again...I call the shop this morning, and leave a message to have the owner call me.  No call as of yet, and I probably won\\'t expect to get one.  I\\'ve also emailed about some other issues in the past, and never got a response.  Mind you - I did get a response when it was about buying new products, but got very minimal feedback when having to have a problem addressed. \\n\\nNeedless to say - I\\'m done with this shop.  I\\'ll take my hard earned money, and business elsewhere.  Besides - I don\\'t want to pay another $35 for another subwoofer to get shipped.  That would be $70, and it will probably blow again, in another year - at which point I would be paying the cost for a new subwoofer anyway, and wasting more time, for a business that obviously doesn\\'t care to retain their clients.',\n",

We came back the next day after getting a call that it was located to find they had detailed the wrong vehicle, and the keys to the one we wanted to see were MIA. We went inside while they searched for keys and the kids played in their toy room. We immediately were approached by their outside consultant who was there from out of state, simply to make sure customers were happy and she wanted to know what could be done to improve customer service. We ended up discussing another option we hadn't thought of, a lease, on a brand new 2015 model. We decided to take it for a test drive and BOOM. Found our car. Financing took less than half an hour and we drove home in our new ride. Getting ready to trade it in next spring and I'll never go anywhere else.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'About 4 months ago I purchased a 1973, yes, 1973 Mercedes 450 SL as a gift for my wife and best friend of 44 years.  After attempting to purchase this truly wonderful piece of German workmanship for over a year, private sale, finally, on December 5, 2015, we owned the 450.  That\\'s a 43 year old automobile.  Its possible that the car and my spousal relationship were created within days of each other.  Both are now mature, incredible parts of my life.  (This is a love story) While all great things require tender, loving and constant care both are, in fact, labors of love.  Recently some safety issues on the 450 required attention.  Normally I would have  addressed them myself and complete the required fixes. However, we recently moved, have prepared several  additional  pieces of real estate for  sale and generally have been insanely busy . Yesterday morning I went on-line looking for a repair center for the 450. The Mercedes of Chandler web site came up early in a Google search.  I was able to *chat* with Joy on-line and her professionalism was immediately evidence.  A very few minutes later we were talking on the phone and getting a service appointment set up.  After a tiny bit of begging, because the 450 issues involved safely, the safely of the best friend mentioned earlier, we locked in a same day appointment. I dropped several projects at my new home and drove over to the dealership. Remember this is a love story.  Joy had set me up with Ray Courtney, one of several Service Reps at the dealership.  Ray and I discussed the critical issues of directional signals, emergency flashers, and the occasional smell of fuel.  Ray was really up-front about the problems of parts for this 43 year old vehicle and asked if I might leave the car and they would provide me with a loaner vehicle. I agreed and was very quickly set-up with a late model c-300 loaner. The 450 quickly disappeared into the shop and a few conversations about parts and delivery times and rehab services in the local area for the up grade items we have planned  on the 450, ensued.  Leon and Andrew, both incredibly helpful and friendly people, stepped up and aimed me at local shops and businesses that could assist us in the planned  up-grades. After a snack and a  bottle of water, on the house, Leon was going over the fantastic features on the loaner car, Ray, my service rep, reappeared and advised the 450 was finished and ready and in just a minute or two my bill was prepared and presented by the before mentioned Andrew, the fellow who, with a youthful and super pleasant manner, settles the financial matters.  The bill was super fair, folks, I am fugal, believe me, super fair. . Leon bought the 450 around and we checked to see that all requested work was completed.  IT WAS. Period.  In less than 6 hours since the \"chat\" with Joy, the work was completed and I was on my way home.  I had had face to face contact with at least a half dozen of the dealership\\'s employees. Each and everyone of them displayed outstanding people skills. Management is doing a lot of things right when the entire staff is so focused on getting the job done right, quickly and correctly.  This dealership can be very, very proud of its SERVICE Department and its staff.  I will sing the praises of this experience for a very long time.  Hats off to Joy, Ray, Leon, Dan and several others, you made this old mans day and then some.  Thanks a MILLION to each of you.      A very happy customer,  Pete Drew    PS- the only thing that could this dealership better is that is would located in my neighborhood.\\nBut then I would not have enjoyed the fun and excitement of the 130 mile round trip in the 450.\\nDid I mention that the 450SL is a convertible roadster with a hard top, rag top and the best top --None. A great mid-sized V-8 engine and matching drive-train.  This vehicle can get you illegal in a heart beat.   And now it\\'s back, thanks to all at this dealership, to it\\'s fun 100%, love-able self',\n",

       "  'text': 'This shop is not recommended by me because they are shady and will intentionally lie in order to get more labor done. They upsold me to $1400 of repair work for a $140 job and still did not diagnose my issue properly. These are the mechanics that your dad told you to avoid. \\n\\n\\nMy experience: \\n\\nThis shop was near my house and figured it was convenient to drop my car off and get work done. I previously had my power steering pump replaced. That job was a few months before this incident, and I was marginally satisfied with the outcome. (They should have discovered the PS Cooler was broken and causing my coolant and PS fluid to mix - poor attention to detail.) That cost me about two hours of my time doing a PS flush and bypassing the PS cooler myself. \\n\\nThis incident was when my AC Compressor Clutch seized up earlier this year (February, I recall). It made an awful screeching sound while driving. Not being strong in the field of AC on cars, I decided to bring it in and get it properly diagnosed. It was somewhat of an emergency due to the severity of the noise and they were only a couple minutes up the road from me. My father is an ASE Certified Master Mechanic and counseled me between the discussions I had with the shop owner and mechanic on duty, and he lives a hundred miles away. \\n\\nThe shop owner informed me that my entire AC Compressor was busted and needed a complete replacement including a flush of the AC system and the Accumulator. After he said this, he quoted me at $1400 to complete it. Assuming this was a \"recommended\" upsell, I asked, \"What is the minimum work to get done so it doesn\\'t screech?\" He backpedaled and said that if you don\\'t do it, bad things will happen. Great, now I\\'m dealing with dishonest mechanics. \\n\\nMy dad explained to me how an AC Compressor works and how the clutch on it operates independently of the compressor. Explaining this to shop owner back and forth, he agreed and explained he doesn\\'t replace AC clutches. In theory, if they were honest and would be willing to do it, they could pick up at least a couple hours of labor. I refused their services and requested they take the AC belt off. When I left, I expressed my disgust in their lack of ethics and how they give great mechanics a poor reputation. \\n\\nI drove my car to my father\\'s house. In a matter of minutes he confirmed that the issue was the AC Clutch assembly and not the AC Compressor. A little searching online, I was able to find a brand new AC Compressor cheaper than a clutch kit and ordered it. The following week, we installed it over about an hour. No recharge or flushing necessary as the AC Compressor was functioning perfectly. \\n\\nWe were still shocked at all the work the shop suggested for such a simple job like this.\\n\\nIf this shop advises you on work, ALWAYS get a second opinion. It is in their best interest to upsell you on services and parts to make higher margins. It is this behavior that will get this shop in trouble with the Attorney General for unfair and misleading business practices. I rarely give \"1\" stars on Yelp, but this place earns it. \\n\\nI will never do business at this shop again and I recommend you don\\'t, either. Alternatively, I have had favorable experiences with Tire Pros in Chandler. \\n\\n\\nSigned,\\nJoe Manna\\n98 Chevrolet Camaro SS 5.7L LS1',\n",

Don't let the atmosphere or Scotch Bottom location sketch you out. They had serious damage fixed in less than two weeks, detailed my car to a level of cleanliness it hasn't seen since I drove it off the lot, and gave me a certificate for a free inspection (or detailing, customer's discretion) any time in the next year (which I will definitely be using).

Since I am from Southern California we decided to check some dealers there that would offer some deals.  We did find a Maserati we liked in California but it sold before we could talk money.

I get the fact that I wasn\\'t parked in the right spot, but there is absolutely NO information on anywhere in the garage that tells you where your car would be when towed. I don\\'t go to U of I so I had no clue and there is very limited information on the university website telling you where your car is taken. I finally figured out where I was supposed to go this morning after an entire weekend of being stranded in this place with no car. I arrived at the towing place fairly distraught and the man working there was the most unpleasant person I\\'ve ever encountered. This man gets his kicks from a predatory and mutually extortive/beneficial relationship with the city of Sham-paign by commissioning tow trucks to drive around and impound cars while giving inadequate information on how to get your car back. The other kicker is the fact that the offices for both U of I parking and Tatman\\'s are not open over the weekend so I had to wait until the entire weekend to be over to find out where my car was and even if I had figured it out earlier, I would have had to pay an extra fee to pick up my car \"after hours\". Once I had gotten there, the aforementioned man working at the desk quite literally berated me in the office for trying to figure out how to pay my tickets online to get my car released. I was clearly upset at my situation and this man snapped at me and upbraided me for being stressed out with what was going on. On top of all that, the amount I had to pay total for both the ticket and the towing fee was $400 dollars which is way more than it honestly should be. Horrible place, horrible service.',\n",

       "  'text': 'This place is a scammers paradise.\\n\\nI called AAA to have my car towed and they were supposed to take me to a car repair shop.  When the tow truck arrived (ABC Towing), the guy talked me into going a different car repair shop then the one AAA suggested.  I kept asking did he have their information and he kept saying he would give it to me  in a second.  After he had my car up on the tow truck he gave me the business card and it was for ABC auto repair....the same company as the towing company.  The tow truck driver said that they would be affordable and most likely able to repair my radiator.  And not have to be replaced.\\n\\nOf course, when I call to tell them what happened to my car (stupid boulders in the middle of las vegas boulevard), and that my radiator was leaking....I told them I wanted to know if they could repair it).  She said they would look at it then let me know.\\n\\nSo she tells me that it would be $400+ for them to replace my radiator, I cant afford that. So I decide to hire a mobile mechanic (very good by the way)\\n\\nSo I go to pick up my vehicle, and have it towed away (and of course AAA assigns them again).  They hand me this $100 diagnostic fee bill.  I told the lady i never approved a diagnostic and im not paying a diagnostic fee bill.  I told THEM what was wrong with my car - why would I turn around and pay you for telling me the same thing I told you?  I had the Nevada Bureau of Automotive Repair ready to be dialed in my phone, but she just \"$0\\'d\" out the bill, and let me go.\\n\\nBut someone please tell me why it took over an hour for them to tow my car to a spot I probably could have pushed my car to?  You have my car, you are the tow company, why am I waiting 1+ hours to have my car towed?\\n\\nSave your money and avoid this place!',\n",

       "  'text': \"For four years I have enjoyed my Audi A7 that was supplied from the Findlay Auto group via Audi Henderson so when I decided I needed a larger vehicle it was an easy choice to check out Findlay owned Land Rover of Las Vegas.\\n\\nUpon entering the the showroom I was promptly greeted by Sales Guide Donny Tackett. He showed me some cars on the lot and offered a test drive. I had researched quite extensively and I had an idea of their inventory. I knew exactly what I wanted. Sport, White with Black roof and a light interior. \\nEasy. \\nBefore I had the chance to share my requirements with Donny we were setting out on our test drive and he pointed out a car that had just arrived. It was covered in the plastic that protects the new car during transit. I couldn't really see what it even was! He explained it was a LTD edition HST. So I had been researching for days, I knew it all, I thought. Wrong. I'd never even heard of this car. Upgraded motor, different interior, wheels and much more. So not white, not a light interior but simply beautiful. \\n\\nAfter test drive we sat at the desk. Gulp. Get ready, here we go.  Hand over the keys to my Audi for appraisal and brace for low offer. Second time today I was wrong. They made a very fair offer, we negotiate briefly, they sweetened the deal a little and we agreed the transaction. It's now One o'clock. We arrange pick up at six. \\n\\nArrive at Six. All is perfect, car is clean. Donny thoroughly explains the car, connects Bluetooth, arranges DMV paperwork. Outstanding. \\n\\nCar dealing can be contentious but shouldn't be. It should be enjoyable and at Land Rover LV I am delighted to say it was extremely enjoyable. \\n\\nGreat experience, my HST is amazing and I thank Donny and the team at Land Rover.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"It's unfortunate that the stellar initial experience I had when purchasing my car was torn to shreds just days later, all courtesy of Berge Ford Manager, Craig Ginsberg. \\n\\nFour days ago I had the pleasure of dealing with Mel and got into a 2017 Ford Fusion. The experience was great, customer service was amazing and I was so happy with my car and Berge......until today. \\n\\nToday my tire pressure sensor came on, so I came into Berge, after calling for an appointment, to have it resolved. To my dismay, I was advised that the tire is irreparable and has to be replaced. To add insult to injury, Berge was not willing to replace the tire for free, even though there was no proof that the tire wasn't damaged when I purchased. \\n\\nNonetheless, when the service department was working on it I made my way to sales to discuss what Berge could do to ensure their customer was taken care of. Unfortunately I had to speak with Craig Ginsberg, who is a chauvinistic, rude and unprofessional individual. \\n\\nCraig advised me that if they had sold me the car with the nail in my tire it would've been flat in hours. LIE, even the service department confirmed that was a lie. Secondly, I advised Craig that I didn't spent 25K on a car a few days ago to pay another $250 for a new tire today. Craig said that wasn't his fault and he doesn't give things away for free and he conveniently dodged my quality of customer service he was providing questions. \\n\\nOnce I asked for Craig's Manager's contact information, I was advised the General Manager of Sales, Steve Countryman, doesn't have a cell phone. LIE. I told Craig I wasn't going to listen to any more deceit and then he offered to call Steve to see if they could do anything since I wasn't accepting his rude demeanor and lack of ethics. Imagine that novel approach.....and within 30 seconds he came back and advised me they'd replace the tire for free. MAGIC! \\n\\nWhen Craig told me that I asked him why it took me going to the extent of asking for Steve's information for them to do the right thing, and he literally looked at me and said, 'What, you don't say thank you? I went out of my way to call Steve and I get you a free tire and all you do is tell me that I'm rude and condescending?' Are you kidding me?!?! Craig is a poor excuse for a Manager, even poorer excuse for a 'leader' and if I were Mr. Berge, I'd be embarrassed to have him work for my company. He was unprofessional, condescending and has no regard for ethics or customer service. \\n\\nI am extremely disappointed with this experience and it's so sad to me that the great individuals I dealt with to buy my car (Mel and Dave) were totally forgotten, all because Craig lies and is on a power trip to feed his ego. \\n\\nNote to Berge......Craig should do some on the job training with Mel and Dave as well as attend some workshops and truly learn how to deal with customers, how to tell the truth and how to do the right thing. My apologies to the quality human beings I dealt with at Berge but after my interaction with Managers like Craig, I'm shocked that anyone returns to Berge. Craig needs help, and if you're not careful he's going to be disrespectful to more and more customers and one of these days he'll mess with the wrong customer. \\n\\nIcing on the cake? I was advised that they'd wash and clean up my car once the new tire was put on......not only did they NOT do that BUT I walked to my brand new car to see the passenger window covered in bird poop. \\n\\nI don't know what else to say, Berge.....so disappointed today that people are allowed to operate on deceit and false promises. You've lost a customer.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"A few days ago I saw their ad on Television. They were selling the 2014 Pilot for $12,8 something. I was very interest in this price, but wanted some more information. So I called them and spoke to Samantha. The first thing I did was ask her to please find out if the car was an automatic or a manual engine. I can drive a stick shift but I didn't want to. I asked her if she could find out for me what was inside this vehicle. She put me on hold and soon came back. She said yes it was an automatic, it had cloth seats, a CD player, Blue Tooth and Sirius Radio. The only thing I was really adamant about was the automatic engine. She asked me for my phone number and I told her I would rather just come out there and see it for myself. She told me to ask for Chad or Josh. So today I went out there. Chad was not available and Josh was busy, but I waited for him. Eventually, he came over to talk to me. I told him what Samantha had told me and I would be interested in seeing the car. He then assigned me to Dennis and told me that after I took the car for a ride he would crunch the numbers for me. I told him I wasn't interested in crunching numbers---that I wanted to pay cash and I wasn't going to play numbers games.  He suggested that I could finance the car, and then pay it all off.  When Dennis pulled the car up, it had a manual transmission--NOT AN AUTOMATIC.  It didn't have Blue Tooth, but I didn't care about that.  I asked to see Josh again. He then preceded to tell me that an automatic would be a little bit more. And he didn't know who told me that the sale was for automatic---I had already told him that, but I told him again. When I asked how much more the automatic would be he said he would crunch the numbers for me and let me know. When he came back he showed me a paper that said $23,000, Are you kidding 11 thousand more. Now he tells me that to get the sale price you have to qualify. Qualify for what  YOU HAVE TO FINANCE your car.  Now why do you have to do that===because the bank gives the dealership a bonus (or as I like to call it, a KICK BACK) for every car that is financed. You also have to be a veteran and there is a list of other qualifying factors. I wouldn't be surprised if you have to have a calico cat.  So if you have the cash and want to pay cash you can but you can't get the sale price.  Now Josh tells me that they have a disclaimer in small print under the ad.  This is so small that you can't even read it with a magnifying glass. What a joke, it is no wonder that car dealers have such a bad reputation they are anything but honest. My advice to anyone that wants to get this deal, be prepared and make sure you qualify for an array of things. My other tip before you go to Monroeville Jeep is DON'T!!!!@\",\n",

Carlos Luna-Aispuro was my Service Advisor and he made a very ugly situation quite bearable and in the end it turned out to be great.  When I purchased my car I bought the extended warranty and as Carlos assured me it was the \"Mercedes\" of warranties. When my car broke down I was leaving for our summer trip to Boston and of course I was panicked about what this might cost me.  Carlos assured me that everything will work out and I should just go and enjoy my vacation.  I did and upon my return my car was still waiting to be approved for the warranty and Carlos gave me a free loaner which was a 2017 Ford Explorer.  When my car work was completed I ended up with a new transmission and an additional 12 months or 12,000 mile warranty on all my parts.  To be honest when I first turned in my car I thought to myself \"this car is a lemon and I am going to get rid of this and go across the street and trade it in.\"  However, my whole attitude changed when I realized how Ford stood by their cars and I walked out of the dealership with my car and a new transmission AND zero money out of pocket.  I will be keeping my car thanks to the AWESOME customer service from Carlos and staying with Ford because they stand behind their automobiles.',\n",

And when they inspected the car, sure enough, they found plenty of things that needed fixing.\\n\\nBut here's where they stand apart from many other places I've been to. I was able to talk with them about what's important and urgent to be fixed...and not be pressured to do anything. They told me what they found, and let me decide what, if anything, I wanted to take care of at that time. Other places will put so much pressure to make a sale. These guys simply helped me make an informed decision.\\n\\nI also got my tires through them, which includes free rotations. I came in today for an oil change and asked to rotate my tires at the same time. They've got other deals that include free maintenance and other deals, when you purchase from them.\\n\\nThe staff I've dealt with have always been friendly. Mike in particular is a great guy. He's friendly, informative, and makes you feel welcome. He even offered me a bottle of water while I waited in the lobby.\\n\\nI noticed they offer free WiFi in their lobby too. I used it to help pass the time on my smartphone while my car got worked on. It's little things like that that set them apart from the competition.\\n\\nSome reviews here complain about expensive repairs or bad service. That's never been my experience. I have never felt pressured, cheated, lied to, or manipulated by these guys at all. Finding an honest auto mechanic is hard. These guys are thorough, yes, and I'm sure they'll find all sorts of issues that can and/or should be repaired at some point -- especially when your car's old. But there's never been any pressure or exaggerations or deceit on their part. You can tell them you're on a budget, and talk about what (if anything) needs to be taken care of immediately, and what can wait until later. They might even be able to dig up a coupon for you, to help you out. \\n\\nI've always received good service from them. They review my invoice before charging me. If during a repair it looks like service will cost more than the original estimate, they'll let me know first. I have absolutely no complaints about these guys. I've dealt with shady and scammy/high pressure mechanics before. But the people at C & R Tires have been honest, straightforward, and sincere as far as I can tell. If you're looking for a mechanic near you, give these guys a try. They're one of the good ones.\",\n",

Their free shuttle took me back to my home for the afternoon, and then they came and picked me up later on when everything was ready to go.\\n\\nWhen I came to pick up my car, they took the time to point out the fact that they had noticed that my radiator hoses were almost completely worn out (which I could see to be true), but they didn't insist on fixing it right then or there.

Meineke has all three, the necessary hoist to lift duelly wheels, the clearance in their bay after they lift a vehicle that is already over 8 feet, and lift that can accommodate the duelly wheels.  If they did not have that, well, Meineke also still has 2 oil change pits.  \\n\\nMeineke was willing to use my parts. though they charge MORE for labor $138/hr, for customer-provided parts, vs. $125/hr for store provided parts, cos they are not making $ on the parts if I bring my own.  \\n\\nI also needed a rush job because I was leaving town for 2 week vacation in this camper and Meineke could do it \"today\".  I left my truck there and they gave me a ride to my other car, to look for the parts.\\n\\nRandy took great care of me, he made my \"worries and concerns\" disappear many times, and not with empty words.  He came through on all his words with actions.  When the U-joints that were supposed to fit my truck, were too large, Randy really hustled to help me find the right part and had several U-joints sent to their shop, but they were also the wrong ones.  I finally found the right size U-joint by taking the old one they removed to Advanced Auto Parts (FKA Carquest), and they had the right one, so I was able to get the 2 hour job done that same day.\\n\\nSince the repair, I drove that truck about 400 miles and the repair feels great.    \\n\\nThis store has a relatively new owner since about a year ago, and Randy has been at this location about 1 year, too.   The employees speak highly of their new owner.  They told me the previous owner only gave \"Christmas bonuses\" only to certain employees, but the current owner gave bonuses to everyone, even the low level employees.  He also hosted BBQs  for the employees after the shop closed, while the previous owner did not do that, and the new owner comes to the shop a lot more often.  \\n\\nSo I hope my 5 star review will help improve their rather poor reviews, which on the date wrote this one, is only 2.5 stars. I see that much of 1 star reviews come from the previous management.\\n\\nOverlook those scary poor reviews from the past, and take a risk and come here and try them out.  Randy will do his best to take care of you!  He is so upbeat, cheerful, and \"diligent\" !!!  The new owner is very lucky to have Randy as his service writer.',\n",

       "  'text': \"This was my first time dealing with Joycity and I was satisfied with the process and pricing.  I purchased a set of Continental WinterContact SI (225/45/17) for $865.00 all-in on Nov 29, 2016.  I also received a $65.00 mail-in rebate with Continental.  They accepted Visa for full payment.\\n\\nI emailed Joycity for a quote and they responded within 24 hours with all tire options for 225/45/17.  The price was slightly cheaper than SimplyTire who I've dealt with a couple times in the past.  SimplyTire was selling the same tires for $770.00 plus taxes plus $3.75 per tire for the Ontario Tire Stewardship (total $887.05 all-in).  $22.05 in savings isn't a whole lot to try a new tire shop but I wanted to give Joycity a shot so I have another option in the future.\\n\\nI ordered the tires online, paid a $100.00 deposit via PayPal, and booked an appointment date/time.  Due to the busy season, the earliest (and most convenient) appointment was Dec 13, 2016 (about 2 weeks from the order date).  I showed up for my appointment at 2:30PM and was out by 4:00PM.  1.5 hour wait.  \\n\\nThe wait wasn't terrible but I was advised by the older gentleman at the front counter that it would take less than 1 hour.  Timing is very important to me as my job is based on scheduled appointments so due to the delay, I had to push out a few of my meetings.  A customer waiting with me experienced the same delay.\\n\\nBesides the timing issue, everything else met my expectations.  Customer service was fine and I didn't expect more.  Other reviews claim that they're not very friendly and I can understand how one can feel that way.  But keep in mind that this is a Chinese-owned business.  You can't expect white-glove service with smiles and hugs.  I'm Chinese and have been experiencing this type of service my whole life.  Straight to the point and efficient.  No pleasantries.  I find SimpleTire the same way.\\n\\nOverall, I would go back if the price is right.\\n\\nP.S. - Some brands that Joycity carry are cheaper or more expensive than what SimplyTire carries.  I suspect this is due to the relationship the shop has with its suppliers.\",\n",

My Dad reccomended going to Japanese Car Service, a place I used to take my previous cars, to get an estimate. It is far from convenient since its located in China Town & also takes 2-3 days to get seen. I told them all the issues Purrfect Auto found, and they said I had been lied to because my front & back brakes are at 60% & all belts are just fine. WOW, this place was so honest!

They are professional and know what they are doing, and at the same time casual and friendly and will work with your unique situation. I completely trust them with my bike. I had a 15k service done on my sport touring bike and now it runs perfectly! Highly recommended!',\n",

       "  'text': 'Update: 11/12/16: I received a call from Dave, service manager, who apologized for the unfortunate experience I had with his department. He offered to replace the motor for the window for free if I was willing to bring my vehicle in again. I drove my vehicle back down again to the dealership and this time my experience was completely different. Dave immediately checked me in and had the repair done in an hour. He delivered on his promise. Just a shame service wasn\\'t received like this experience the first time. I will increase the stars for the attempt to make me happy. I only hope in the future they use my experience as an example to provide great customer service on the initial visit. \\nThank you Dave. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThink again before taking your car to the service department here. Completely incompetent people all around. I made an appointment for 11:30 to drop off my Yukon for an oil change and a new motor in the passenger door that died so the window wouldn\\'t roll up. Additionally I asked if they could fix the side panels on the vehicle that were falling off. I was informed that they would have to coordinate with the body shop for the panels and I said no problem. I called yesterday at 4:00 pm to inquire as to the status and see how much the panel work would be. Was told they still hadn\\'t been able to contact anyone at the body shop. I said no problem, keep the car overnight as I would prefer to not have to bring it in again for that particular fix. Was called at approximately 10:30 am today to tell me they were still waiting for an \"exact\" quote but was told it would be approximately 1500.00. I declined that price (as well as them trying to get me to buy 4 new tires at 650.00 because the tread on 2 tires were bit low)  and was told I could come pick up my car as the oil change and window fix were done. I get to the dealer at 2pm to pick up my car. No paperwork at cashier. Have to wait on paperwork. Finally get paperwork and after I pay a lower fee then expected I ask the window was fixed correct? Jeff service rep looks at paperwork and says \"yes\". Then goes and asks someone to look at paperwork and comes back and says the fee I paid was for the them to diagnose the back latch that wasn\\'t broken nor did I request to have checked because someone wrote the wrong \"code\". So I said, \"you have had my vehicle for over 24 hrs and no one noticed the back passenger window is down and won\\'t roll up and it hasn\\'t been fixed?\" The answer is Yes!!!!! So now I am furious and I state I want a manager and my money back. Go to manager who says sorry for mix up, they would fix immediately and give me a loner to drive for a few hours. I say okay. They then come and tell me they don\\'t even have the motor needed to fix the window in stock or on property!!!!!!!!! So needless to say, I made sure I was refunded for the diagnosis charge they charged me for a back hatch that wasn\\'t broken in the first place!!!!!!! So after this service shop having my vehicle for 26 hours, all that was done was an oil change that I had pre paid!!!!!!! Needless to say, not only will I not be returning to this dealership service department to get the repairs needed that I tried to get done, but I was also seriously considering trading in my 2008 Yukon Denali with 35,000 miles on it and buying a new Sierra. Not happening after this horrific experience.',\n",

I indicated first time there so just the  Platinum package for now.  Once that was settled the attitude seemed to change.  The folks inside were very nice, asked about how long and told 30-45 min, so went for quick walk.  Came back and saw my car in bay area being worked on.  Waited inside for a bit and finally went up to the front desk and asked don't they call numbers or have listed somewhere to know if done.  The guy indicated busy today, otherwise would come in and announce, so walked me out and told me to give ticket to one of the guys.  Gave me car keys and started to walk back to where my car was parked at back, when got to my car turned around the guy was gone.  I got in and oil everywhere from the leather cleaner, smelled terrible.  My trunk wasn't vacuumed.  Started to walk back, but thought forget it I had it done on Saturday and even yesterday my daughter was asking what is that smell when she got in. I certainly didn't expect a detail job, but would have expected my trunk clean and not all kinds of oily stuff streaked across the trim inside.  I ended up taking a rag and cleaner to it myself and will have to go vacuum it later today.  Only reason a 2 was because at least it was somewhat cleaner and my tires looked better.

He then tells me i need left caliber replaced, rotors replaced, clean and adjust on back, and brake system flush. Red flag if my brakes haven't been changed in a year why would I only need a clean and adjustment on the back? Mmmmhhhhh when i told him to put it back together he offered to take 50$ off.

An hour later I'm taken inside shop for them to show me concerns with my car...caliber needed to be greased not replaced nothing wrong with rotors shiny and clean as if they had been taken out of box....brakes needed to be replaced..duuhi knew that thats why i took it in to ger warranty honoredas i have been doing for past 3yrs or so.

I came mid-day on a Friday in to request a few tour books--she helped me right away, with great friendliness, and provided \"extras\" of maps and special magazine guides to areas where I\\'ll be traveling. She then asked if I needed AAA travel agent assistance for my trip, and set me up within minutes to talk with an agent. He answered my questions and shared a few key tips for my upcoming travel to Canada. I couldn\\'t ask for a better experience, and it is consistently like this when I walk in to ask for something.',\n",

When it was my turn I drove up and Mark was friendly and personable. He noted that my car had been tested in California very recently but unfortunately would have to be re-tested in Nevada. He asked me if I knew about the VIN Check required (I did). I asked him if he had change for a tip and he said yes.

       "  'text': \"Great customer service. This was my first time at this repair shop. I took my Nissan in yesterday to get a routine oil change and have my tires rotated. I made an appointment the day before for 11:30 and by 11:45 my car was up on the rack. They did a great job of checking all the fluids, changing the oil and rotating the tires as promised. They didn't try to sell me anything, which was nice.  As a woman, I've always been very wary of car repair places. A lot of these places take advantage of women and we wind up paying more than we should. I didn't get that sense with this place. It was clean, they were friendly, they explained everything, and they were quick. Good experience. \\n\\nIt was confirmed today that they really do take great pains to give excellent customer service. When I got home yesterday after the tires were rotated, I noticed that one of my hubcaps was missing. I swung by this morning to see if it had fallen off in the parking lot. The owner was there and he arranged for me to get the hubcaps replaced no charge. I tried to pay for part of it and he was very firm that this was on him. I own a business and I understand that sometimes you can't help what your employees do, no matter how much you train them. So I admire a company that understands if something goes wrong, you do what you can to fix it. No one is perfect, but being willing to look for a solution is a very important part of customer service. \\n\\nI understand this because I teach it... I've been a customer service trainer for decades. This experience has become my newest great example of how to treat your customers. Thanks guys!\",\n",

He said, \"It\\'ll be ready by 5.\" It was 1:00 when I brought it in, I couldn\\'t believe it would take four hours. I had stuff to do (I got married 3 days later). As I stayed in shock, I went in to the receptionist to pay. I asked her, \"So he said it would be done by 5. If they are done sooner, will they call me and let me know?\" She said \"Absolutely!\"\\n\\nSo I try to kill time with what\\'s around me since I\\'m car-less and walking around.

I get in and notice the seats are dry-- my car has been done for a long while and no one called me.\\nI\\'m so angry and hurt.

       "  'text': \"I'm in Tucson, but was willing to make the drive to Phoenix if the right car was available. What looked like the right car was posted at this dealership. I called and communicated I was in Tucson but interested in the car. The woman was very friendly and expressed this was a great find. There were four long shots of the exterior posted, but no interior shots. She worked to get me interior shots, which was appreciated. I spoke with the dealership three times - two of the three times I asked if there was any damage, etc., I should know about. Both times nothing specific was mentioned, so we made the two hour trek north.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, we saw immediately that the car had a four inch gash on the back passenger door - like a car door had hit it - it was damage I would have expected to be mentioned during my previous conversations with them. I understood that I was buying a used car and was prepared for some dents, but this was deep. My husband  has rehabbed many cars and determined this would not be fixed by paintless dent repair - the dealership disagreed, but said they would not fix it. We called our friend who assesses auto body damage, explained the damage, and he said the repair would be in the $600-800 range. We suggested that they could adjust the price to accomodate us having to fix it. \\n\\nThe sales guy agreed that seemed reasonable and went to the finance guy. He came back with the full sales price. They said they had already spent $2,800 fixing it when they normally spend $1,800. We then asked what was wrong with it - they said they preferred to think of it as them fixing the problems for us (except the door). The two primary items they listed as having been fixed were the tires and the 40,000 mile inspection. Tires are expensive, no doubt, but not $2,800 expensive. And the car had 47,000 miles on it - meaning the previous owner went 7,000 miles over the due date for the inspection. This expense should not have been held against the new purchaser. \\n\\nAfter some haggling, they offered $200 off. We walked ... then drove two hours home.\\n\\nGlad I held out and found the perfect car elsewhere.\",\n",

I took my car in for routine maintenance and asked if they would have a look at the problem.  They performed the routine maintenance I requested and although I was a little bit taken aback by the price for the inspection ($100-$200 based on what they had to do) I have trusted them for quality service on other vehicles.  They did a diagnostic and the problem was a misfire on cylinder 2.  They went out of their way to call my dealership to see if the problem was covered under warranty, which it was.  As it turned out Nissan had to replace my engine.  This mechanic could have chased the problem from sensor to sensor and fuel filter and ignition etc etc but they didn't, they found the correct path for me to save money and get my car running perfect again.  After that Matt who is the friendliest and most helpful person you will EVER meet at a mechanic offered to take my car to the dealership and pick it up for me, free of charge.  He even knocked off most of the inspection charge because they quickly realized they wouldn't be doing the work to repair it.  There are cheaper mechanics out there but the quality of service here not only made my experience much better but ended up saving me potentially thousands of dollars worth of repairs that were ultimately covered under my warranty.\\n\\nAlthough there is a small premium to get work done here (there are shady mechanics that will do jobs for less) the customer service by itself, let alone the quality of work, honesty and integrity of the staff are well worth the marginal pricing differences.  \\n\\nKeep up the good work!

       "  'text': \"To start off, just like almost everyone else, I hate going to a car dealership. It can be stressful, time consuming, and and sometimes disappointing. Fortunately, Findlay Chevrolet is not that type of place. \\nSo, I had a dodge challenger (big mistake giving up my Silverado for it) and after a year was wanting to back into a truck. I had the misfortune of going to the competitor next door which was just awful and will be another review altogether for them. After the deal went sour with Ford, I was thinking that I would be stuck with my Dodge forever. Luckily, I received a phone call from Chris at Findlay who was trying to save me money on my Silverado which I didn't have anymore. He was thankfully interested in seeing what I was driving and if I was happy with it. After telling him my story, he was patient and nice enough to see if there was anything he could do. After a few minutes, set up an appointment and had the pleasure of working with Nathan. I can say that this was one of the best visits I've ever had at a car dealership. Nathan wasn't pushy and made it stress free trying to pick out a truck. The finance guy was super friendly and also the guy who got my new Silverado ready for me. \\nI'm very happy with my experience and not to mention my deal for my brand new truck! As a plus, they have free fountain drinks and coffee which is awesome. I would recommended Findlay Chevrolet to anyone wanting a good deal and an enjoyable visit to a car dealership.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Don't expect much and you'll be fine. If you need help of any kind forget it. Service is not what Superstore is known for. Low prices. But even then, you have to know your prices otherwise you may not save any money. What I hate is that you often have to buy 3 or 6 of something to get the lower price which is completely annoying as a single person. I don't need 6 cobs of corn. I only need 1 or 2. That's why I don't shop here much. Line ups can be horrendous if have more than what you can use in the self checkout line. And then you sometimes get the dumbass who has 50 items and takes his sweet time with it all. Those people should be banned from using these lanes. \\n\\nProduce can be hit or miss sometimes. I just don't think the drive is worth it for me personally. I refuse to buy meat or fish here because it just doesn't look right. And the bulk section sometimes scares me as I've seen people reach right in with their hands and start munching away. Geez! People have no manners. \\n\\nI have bought glasses at the optical place at one of the other locations. Price was good and it only took a week or so to have them made. In the summer I check out the bedding plants but again you need to buy 10 in order to get the lower price. Not worth it for the single chick here. \\n\\nAt the end of seasons you can get good deals on stuff like today I got bbq brushes for half price. BBQ's, lawn chairs, tables and other stuff was discounted big time.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I have never felt so let down as a costomer. My 7 month pregnant wife and I have been in a vehicle debacle for going on 3 weeks. We have been searching on Craigslist for 3 weeks and have had no luck. We finally decided to try a delarship.  We arrived at this delarship. We met with one sale man, who then passed us off to a drunk sales person who smell like booze and cigarettes.  We let him know that we were looking for a reliable, low milage, and at a specific out the door priced vehicle. We were then informed of a 2009 Nissan Altima. As we were getting ready to take the vehicle for a test drive we met a 3rd sales person. The vehicle drove well. Every one knows that purchasing a vehicle is a big decision.  After the test drive my wife and I let the sales person know that we would take a couple of hours to make a final decision. Prior to leaving we did meet with the used care sales supervisor who did know of our cash purchase intention. We left then returned a short time later. No welcoming sales person and watched 2 separate sales persons act like they did not want to have anything to do with us. Then the use care sale supervisor arrived with a paper with the out the door price of 4 thousand more than what we advised in the first place. We again told them that they knew our initial intentions and advised that there was a miscommunication, no reasoning from the sales staff to make things right. Pinical Nissan staff need advise in truth and honest business reputation. We wasted 4 hours of time we will never get back. This could have all been fixed if the would have just said that they do not have anything on the lot in outer cash price range.',\n",

I was traveling from Palm Springs, CA back to Boise, ID when a tire blew out on my truck 30 miles from Henderson. My truck is a full size Dodge Ram with 35\" tires, not an easy tire to replace in a pinch. We called Discount from the road and they said they had something in stock that would work.\\nWe arrived on the spare and spoke to Alex, there was a line of cars waiting for service but he was very fast at coming out to look at my truck. My right front tire had blown out, but the left front was the same tire and age as the blown tire, Alex inspected the tires and informed me the other tire was likely on its way out as well. He didn\\'t try to force me into another tire but given the fact I was still 750 miles from home I decided on two new tires.\\nMy rear tires need replaced soon as well so now I was looking at $1,500-2,000 for a set of four, but they didn\\'t have the style of tire I wanted in stock. Alex started looking for a single tire just to get me home and it was coming in around $400. He then offered to check in the back and came out with two used tires in the size I needed and gave me an absolutely amazing deal on them. We settled on that and despite how busy they were 45 minutes later we had two front tires and were back on the road to home.\\nI was seriously dreading going to a tire shop when they knew I was desperate and had every opportunity to squeeze a lot of money out of me. Alex went above and beyond to find a solution for me and to get us back on the road as fast as possible. Can\\'t recommend Alex enough!',\n",

Nick knew every detail, and I mean every detail about our future vehicle.  We came loaded with questions - and he knew the answers.  He personally showed us all the bells and whistles about the vehicle we were about to buy - he blew our mind.  Once we selected our new vehicle, we sped through the finance process.  We came pre-approved from Ford which made the experience less stressful.   \\n\\nLeaving that day, we had questions re: our financial plan and were not completely satisfied.  I reached out to Nick who quickly directed us to Jim Eagle. Together Jim and Joey worked in tandem to engage a plan to \"make sure we were completely satisfied\"  Throughout this, Nick kept in contact, making sure we were being taken care of.  Jim finalized our options available today and set an appointment for us to sit with Joey and review those options.  Joey slowed down and answered every question, discussed every figure to ensure we were ready to finalize \"the deal\".  \\n\\nMy overall goal was that every time I pressed the ignition, I wanted NO unsettled feelings about my purchase.  Tonight I pressed that ignition button and we drove home from Peoria Ford. The best part, I did not have one worry.  Thank you to Peoria Ford!  \\n\\nNext week, we bring in our new Explorer to get a paint defect \"speck\" repaired that was discovered when we did the final inspection.

Seems like a legit place but the work done was half assed.\\n\\nI brought it in because of a squeaking noise and a rattling sound.  I rebuilt it prior and thought it would be good for a professional to take a look at it.  They couldn\\'t find the problem but told me the best they could do was a bearing kit for $550.  It would take a knowledgable person no more than two to three hours for the job and the kit is about $90 on ebay.  That\\'s a lot of money for labor and they did a sloppy job.\\n\\nFirst of all I had to take it back because they spray painted the front of the case where the transmission fluid from the transmission will come into contact.  I had to argue with Jeff that I didn\\'t want paint there.  He finally said to take it back and he\\'ll remove it.  Also a half assed job because there was still paint that I had to remove myself.  Sorry I don\\'t want cheap spray paint dissolved in my transmission.  Not to mention the case was brand new and they did not have to paint it.  They also did a poor job spray painting it as they didn\\'t use any masking.(see pictures)  The spray paint is also flaking off.\\n\\nNow I\\'m about to put the case back in my truck and I check to see if they put the magnet back.  They did not.  Now I have to take it back apart and put one back in myself.  More work for me when I paid a professional to take care of it.  Also they put too much RTV around the case which the manual says not to do because it could clog up the screen to the oil pump and burn out the bearings.\\n\\nVery poor and unprofessional job by a place that call them self \"Pro.\"  Skip this place and find some one who cares about their work.\\n\\n\\n\\n*Talked to Jeff over the phone.  Initially, on our very first coversation, he seemed very knowledgable about transfercases.  It become apparent after each conversation his knowledge is very limited.\\n\\nI told him about the problem and he didn\\'t offer a refund not even an apology, just tried to argue and justify himself.

We'd been to several other dealerships Monday morning and were headed to Costo for a hot dog lunch when we found we were passing the Hyundai dealership and decided to kick their tires!  It was probably about 12:30pm. A guy in a lavender shirt was standing outside and greeted us as we approached the door.\\nHe smiled and asked what we were looking for and we said we didn't know anything about Hyundais and were looking for a small, has efficient car.  He walked us through a couple and then suggested that we drive one.  He was friendly, fun, and truly knowledgable.  Julian Foldes, by name, became our new best friend.  My husband gave him a REALLY tough time on the price and by the time we decided that this was the car we wanted it was about 2:30 and Julian had a couple guys go to Costco and pick up hot dogs for us!!!  Can you imagine?  And today when we picked up the car, he went through all the bells and whistles so that we know how to operate the vehicle!  HE's THE\\nMAN you want to deal with.

       "  'text': \"Never going to Berge again.\\n\\nI purchased a car from Berge Ford at the end of June. Having limited credit, I had my father co-sign the loan to receive a better interest rate. We both adamantly expressed that this was to be my car, in my name, paid for by me; the sole purpose of his name was a lower interest rate.  The following frustration has transpired after the purchase: \\n\\n I signed the purchase contract the night of the purchase, and was expressly told that the name listed first on the contract did not matter. My father's name was first and mine was second. Reluctantly, we decided the finance director knew best.  Days later I was told that the name listed first did, in fact, matter. My name had to be first to qualify for a college rebate, so I had to go back to the dealership, pick up the contract, and have it signed a second time.\\n\\nSeveral days after signing the contract a second time, I was informed by Berge that they made a mistake on the zip code in the contract. I had to go back to the dealership, pick up the contract, and have it signed a third time.  A couple days after that, I found out the zip code mistake was still not fixed, and had the finance director actually come to my house to have the contract signed a fourth time.\\n\\n After submitting the correct contract with my name listed first, mail began to arrive in my father's name, despite assurances that the car was in my name.  The car ownership card, the warranty documentation, the Sirius free trial information, and all routine mail from the dealership arrived in my father's name, rather than mine.  I had to go out of my way to get the problem fixed with the dealership, and have all mail re-sent in my name. To this day, Sirius still sends mail to my father based on the information that Berge provided\\n\\nWhile purchasing my car I was expressly told by the salesman that the Ford College Rebate had to be submitted after the purchase was made. I found out later (on the Ford website) that I could have done it at the time of purchase. I brought a copy of my diploma and the Ford-assigned rebate tracking number into the dealership in mid-July, as instructed online.  After months of not hearing anything about my rebate, I contacted the dealership in mid-November and was told they somehow did not have a copy of my diploma.\\n\\n I re-submitted a copy of my diploma and tracking number via email, and was told that my rebate would be mailed the week of December 28.  On January 15 I contacted the dealership, told them I had not yet received my rebate, and was told that they would track the issue and make sure I got it.   By February 9th I had not heard anything, so I filed a complaint to Ford corporate. On February 17 I finally received my rebate, 7 months after first applying for it.  The rebate was addressed to my father, despite the fact that all rebate information was in my name.  I had to go back to the dealership and have a new check re-issued in my name.\\n\\nAfter dealing with these problems, I wrote an email to the general manger and explained what I went through.  I received no response.  Once Berge has sold you a car, they do not care about you as a customer.  Save yourself the trouble and buy a car anywhere but Berge.\",\n",

Like how I found a way to work Montell and Lenny into an airport parking review? I deserve 5 stars.\\n\\nMy fellow North Carolina angel Holly B is the one who introduced me to this. You check-in at the gate and then a driver follows you to your parking spot. I pulled into one by a giant puddle. I got out and the driver said, \"let\\'s find you a better spot so your feet don\\'t get wet.\" Lifesaver. I found a new spot, he grabbed my giant suitcase to load onto the van, and drove me right to the airport.\\n\\nNine days later, same drill but in reverse. Those drivers were lifesavers. This girl packed way too much in her suitcase. It was too heavy for me to try and get in the back of Not Lance. (that\\'s my car). Every worker I dealt with was super friendly, too.\\n\\nCheck out was simple and easy. The cashier even offered me a bottle of water. This was nice because I had just flown in from San Francisco and forgot what humidity felt like. Holy. My total for parking nine days: $54.45.\\n\\nI didn\\'t make a reservation online. I would recommend doing that, especially during busy holidays. I believe it\\'s also a little cheaper if you book online. They also offer a frequent parker program and corporate discounts.',\n",

I come to this Coscto in particular at least 2-3 times a month. I love that their fruits and vegetables are in a controlled temperature room and they are always stocking throughout the day. \\n\\nI would recommend their pound cake, cheese cake, Kirkland all beef hot dogs, pizza from the food court, and so much more! One of the things I value the most is if you take something home and you find the quality is not good, you can bring it back and they will exchange it for you for free. One time I bought strawberries that were starting to mold. I called them and told them about it and they said to bring them back in and they would give me a new pack of fruit. They do that with all of their food. Just extremely customer friendly and helpful. I was sad to learn that the food court go rid of their ice cream bar which was very popular. Hopefully they bring it back. Their pizzas are HUGE. All pizzas are 1 size which I would measure to be XXL. They can feed up to 6-7 adults. We often call ahead of time and place a order for a full pizza so that when we get to the store, the pizza is made and ready. Much better than Pizza Hut and your other typically pizza chain. Their pizzas are amazing. \\n\\n\\nCostco is my first choice for getting tires. They typically run a Michellin deal buy 4 tires and get $70 off. \\n\\n\\nThe accept debit cards, cash and checks. They DO NOT accept credit cards unless they are American Express. \\n\\n\\nLove this place.',\n",

There is not a better car wash value anywhere I\\'ve ever been.\\n\\nThis is a well-staffed ride-through car wash in South Euclid.  \\n\\nYou can get your car washed for as cheaply as $5 (maybe even cheaper if you buy the club card).  It costs $7 if you are willing to buy a 5-wash book.  It\\'s been the same price for the wash book for the past 7 years, even though the individual price has crept up to $10.\\n\\nBut, even at $10, it\\'s still the best deal anywhere.\\n\\nWhen you pull in, there is at least one person (almost always two) spraying any bad areas of your car (bugs, etc) with solution, and scrubbing difficult-for-the-auto-wash-to-reach areas with continuously washed scrub brushers.  When you come out on the other side, your car has been thoroughly washed, clear-coat-protected, and your tires even armor-alled.  Like any auto car wash, the very worst stuck-on bugs will remain at the end, but again, it\\'s better than anything other than using bug and tar remover and a scrub brush.\\n\\nBehind the car wash, they have several vacuums and coin operated detailing products like windex-soaked towels, armor-all soaked towels, etc.  The facility is always clean and the staff always friendly.\\n\\nAlso, despite their clear warnings limiting their liability on loose items being ripped off your car, they go above and beyond.  I had just bought a new Honda Pilot and the car wash ripped off the rear window wiper that I forgot was there.  The owner was there when I realized it, and he shut down the whole car wash while a staff member went in to find it.  When they found it, it was damaged, and he gave me his business card and told me to send him the bill and he\\'d pay for it.  \\n\\nI didn\\'t take him up on it because he had no obligation to pay for it, and because this car wash has saved me hundreds of dollars over the years in car washing costs.  It was a $20 part at Honda.\\n\\nThis is one of those \"seems too good to be true\" places, but it isn\\'t.  It\\'s cheap and effective, and it\\'s run by people who care about how clean your car ends up.  \\n\\nOh one other story... once during winter, I had a lot of residual ice on my roof.

       "  'text': 'Earnhardt Toyota went above my expectations! I have never had such a positive experience at car dealership before (or ever). I was searching high and low for a specific 4runner model and could not find what I was looking for where I live in San Diego, CA. I have family in Phoenix area and thought I could just make a trip out of it if I could find what I was looking for in AZ. Well Earnhardt had the exact trim of the 4runner I couldn\\'t live without so I started negotiating online with a gentleman named Jacob C. He did what he could and after a few days of emailing back and forth he notified me that he could get me what I wanted for the exact price I wanted to pay. I explained to him how far away I lived and how important it was to me to just drive out, do the deal, NO haggling, and be done. He assured me this would happen so I made the commitment, and drove to AZ. I\\'m not going to lie, I was a little reluctant and thought they were just feeding me some BS to get me out there and take my money but surprisingly it wasn\\'t like that at all. Jacob wasn\\'t able to be there he day I came but had another sales member help me, Robert M. He was hands down, the nicest, most knowledgeable guy. He\\'s worked for Toyota for a very long time and never pressured me once to buy something extra or made me feel inferior. He wrote up my paper work, got me to finance and really made me and my family feel comfortable. I met a few other members of their team: Joe M (Sales Manager), Robert F (Internet Manager), and a guy named Boomer who was the finance guy. All were very nice. Back in finance they did try to get me into the extended warranties, which I was not interested in, and they wrote up my contracts quickly and accurately. I was out of there in not time, with my dream car, and I felt like I got the best deal out there. San Diego dealers and other AZ Toyota dealers would not match the price they sold me my new 4runner for!\\nMy Grandfather who came with me said \"they\\'re so good at this dealership, makes me want to buy a car!\" This means a lot coming from his mouth. \\nGO HERE, you wont be disappointed.',\n",

Good customer service comes from the top down so this is why I have an issue with the service I have received. \\n\\nUpdate on the truck took it to another dealership that knows what they are doing and guess what the return oil line for the turbo is leaking. This means they have to pull the new turbo and repair the leak and put the new turbo (if it is not bad now) back on. \\n\\nThis will take 2 days not 5 and will cost me another 2K. Worst craftsmanship I have seen at any dealership anywhere.',\n",

(Which is silly since a 12ah battery can be fully charged in 20 minutes). \\n\\nBrought in a 4 month old battery that wouldn't hold a charge - using the HD tender and a standard 12v 6a charger. The battery case states 12 month replacement if defective. I have a couple of bikes and am pretty familiar with how motorcycle batteries work. So this should be easy. \\n\\nNo chance. The store was not remotely busy. The manager hid in his office. The parts guys tried but wouldn't actually do anything to take care of the customer. \\n\\nFinally the battery test came back inconclusive. Had I not waited for 2 hours I doubt they'd have covered it since their test showed the battery as good (though it was smoking hot after 2 hours on the charger). \\n\\nThis is why we shop online guys.

There seems to be a common thread here with both the customers responses and the dealership. I experienced virtually everything I read on multiple reviews.

Went in for a car that was listed at 16,xxx on the vehicle and had an internet price of 14,xxx. After being asked all kinds of finical questions they finally came back with a price of  over 23,000 . There were all sorts of add ons. $900 paint protection on a 5 year old used car. $500 window tint . $3500 extended warranty cost. $1300 gap insurance cost. Old school tactics of asking you what your payment amount is versus giving you the actual cost of the car.\",\n",

I don't know if Jacksons is owned by Danny's or if it's a completely separate business, but they sure act like the old Danny's. Danny's was AWFUL, always trying to upsell you on crap you didn't need, at least at the time they said you needed it. Everything always seemed to be on the brink of collapse when you took your car to Danny's. I finally saw that it was a new place and decided to try it out for a quick and basic oil change + whatever free car wash came with that. As soon as I pull in, they try to get me to upgrade to a paid car wash on top of my oil change. When I decline, the girl calls over a third guy, who pops my hood, points to some arbitrary crap and tells me that he HAS to use synthetic oil or otherwise the regular oil change will void my warranty. When I told him to just use regular oil, he actually told me that he was NOT ABLE to do a regular oil change on my car b/c of this reason. I've heard A LOT of dumb s&*! in my life...but this was up there. I know exactly what this guy was thinking - I'm 38 years old, but I must have looked like a dumb young kid that day with my t-shirt, bball shorts, and hat, b/c that's the only reason I can think of as to why he would try to make me believe that drivel. No, my 4 cylinder Nissan Sentra base model does NOT need synthetic oil, and there is no manufacturer's warranty that will be voided unless synthetic oil is used. Just utterly asinine and insulting that he tried to make me believe this, I guess he thought I would just agree to anything. It's actually downright deceptive, as I'm SURE he knew better and was intentionally just trying to get me to spend more money. My next web page visit will be to the BBB's site.\\n\\nAnd to the very misguided and dishonest employee at Jacksons Car Wash that tried to rip me off - read the owner's manual sir, I've left a link to it for you. Nowhere in there does it say 1. that I MUST use synthetic oil, nor 2. that any warranty will be voided if anything other than synthetic oil is used. Please STOP LYING to your prospective customers.\\n\\n\\nhttps://owners.nissanusa.com/content/techpub/ManualsAndGuides/Sentra/2015/2015-Sentra-owner-manual.pdf\\n\\n\\nJust to be clear, my actual rating is ZERO STARS, Yelp just hasn't made that possible yet.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I called Kal tire inquiring about the price of calipers for my Dodge caravan. The reason was I had my brakes done at Active Green and Ross at the 186 The Queensway location. 7 months later my brakes sounded like they were grinding already. I took it back to Active Green and Ross and was told my calipers needed to be replaced. But I didn't trust them( see my full review on Active)\\nA lady answered the phone and told me to bring my van in to see if I really needed new calipers. \\nI brought the van in and they checked my calipers and brake pads. She told me my calipers were fine. The problem was the cheap brake pads. They were supposed to be high quality which was not. I didn't need need new calipers like I was told. All I needed was new pads. Which I got them to replace for 240$ plus hst. \\nI also brought my other vehicle in to see what was wrong because the steering wheel was shaking. They told me what was all wrong with my car. And how much everything would cost. There was a lot of things wrong.  But they never pushed me into doing the repairs. Which was different than other mechanic shops. It was nice to feel like they weren't all about getting your money but to work with you to see what was important to fix first and what can wait. She told me to think about it and call to make an appointment when I decide what to do. \\nWhat I really like about Kal tire at this location is they are really friendly and they do little things like top of your oil,clean your tires and even saw my headlights where sunk in in and they popped it back out at no charge. \\nI been jumping from mechanic to mechanic for some time now. Looking for one I can trust. Now I have one I will taking my business too. A place I feel I won't be taken advantage off. Great Job KAL TIRE!\",\n",

Well, Superstar Car Wash stood out in a negative way for me. \\n\\nI took my brand new truck into their car wash, and it was damaged in the car wash. Fortunately, it was just the antenna. So, it's not the end of the world. But, it was a $60 antenna to replace. \\n\\nThey do warn that some antennas may become damaged. But, BEFORE I took my truck into the car wash, I took the time to walk over and talk to their employees and I specifically asked them if my type of antenna could get damaged. They assured me it would be safe, at which time I entered the car wash. \\n\\nThe car wash mangled it. \\n\\nAfter it was damaged, the responsible employee confessed it was his fault to the manager. \\n\\nSo, I contacted the corporate office and I had a written acknowledgement from the manager that it was their fault. But, after I attempted to contact their corporate office, they just ignored me, and wouldn't return my attempts to contact them. \\n\\nSo, this negative review is based on the company's attempts to pretend that the problem didn't exist after they were directly responsible for causing damage to my truck.\",\n",

They vacuumed AROUND  my floor mats, Didn\\'t wipe the seats at all, center console still had remnants from an iced mocha. They wiped my navigation screen with a tire shine rag and it took a few hits with glass cleaner to get the oily film off. The windows inside looked way worse than when they started. Worst of all the wax for the outside of the car that was used wasn\\'t completely wiped off and on a black car it really shows. Ran it through a car wash a couple days later cuz I couldn\\'t stand to look at it. This place is a complete waste of your money. I approached the individual that greeted me and talked me into spending the $65 and showed him the fiasco. He was in disbelief when he saw under the floor mats, anyhow he brought it back to the vacuum station and re-did it himself. \\nNot going back',\n",

       "  'text': \"I've gone here before and had okay experiences (despite them ALWAYS finding something wrong with my car, which isn't surprising since it's a 2001) but on my latest visit to get my oil changed, I had a change of heart. First, they told me there were multiple issues with my car that need to be fixed, as per usual, and pressured me to have them fix it. After they finished and asked me to pay, I tried to use a 50% off oil changes coupon from their website and the man at the counter told me they don't honor those coupons unless they are disclosed at the beginning (this policy is not written on the coupon, I might add). He finally agreed but told me the $20 oil change coupon was a better deal. I believed him without checking and learned later that I would've paid less with the 50% off coupon. The icing on the cake was when I got home and I had someone check my fluids and tires, only to learn that my tires were 10 lbs lower than they should be, which means that Meineke never checked my tire pressure, which is supposed to be included in an oil change. Overall, I was disappointed and probably won't be returning.\",\n",

I have dealt with a few of the other service advisers and they\\'re generally helpful as well; EJ goes the extra mile when he has to, even including taking the empty spot in the cashier\\'s office so I could pay and get going after waiting quite a while for an emergency repair.\\n\\nThe work I\\'ve had done in the past, be it warranty work, regular checkups, or repairs, has been done correctly and I\\'ve not had to return the vehicle for any reason due to improperly executed repairs. Sorry to hear that some have had this experience. I realize that as human beings, technicians in any type of work will make mistakes; this is normal, it\\'s part of doing business. Heck, it\\'s part of life! But...

This past week, I realized I hadn\\'t gotten my car inspected! Talk about odd. I\\'m usually a month ahead of time, but here it was with five days to go. I got on the website, made an appointment for 8:15 am (it was 7:15 am when I did this) and got up to the dealership right at 8:15. EJ was surprised to see me-- I guess the bugs aren\\'t worked out yet on the shop getting all the info from the website, but he assured me it wouldn\\'t be a problem, even though Mondays are generally busy. \\n\\nI had my car back and out the door at one hour and five minutes later.

Well, we shall see how management corrects any mishaps. I\\'ll always be willing to let someone try to fix a problem fairly. With respect. Sorry to hear of others having had a bad time of it.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Okay so at first glance and from the reviews I read on yelp I really like this place but after getting my car back...well that is a different story. I will start by giving credit where credit is due...\\n   The staff was overall friendly and the waiting area was pretty awesome with refreshments and free ice cream and cookies.. They also offer a flat rate tow to their shop for 50 bucks from anywhere in the valley which was also awesome...\\nNow for the part I wasnt happy with...\\n  I was having an issue with my alternator charging my battery... so they replaced my alternator and wiring harness which was fine but when I looked at the bill it was itemized $98 for locating the faulty wire and another $98 to replace and install the alternator...and 172 for the part (which was only 165 at oriellys when i looked but whatever..) and then 50 for the tow...anywho i paid 385 total...and when i picked up my car....the mf STILL wouldnt start..which i understoood was because the alternator needed a chance to charge the battery....fine but i thought it was a bit unprofessional to let me get in my car only to turn the key and not here it turn over it made me instantly upset... another issue I had is the fact that the mechanic who i guess happens to be the owner said something about me having a mexican imitation battery in my car and its a yellowtop optima battery that I have a reciept from auto zone for $202...not a fake...at all...the company that makes them now manufactures in mexico...all u have to do was look at their website...they also made comment in my paperwork that when they disc the battery my car idled normal...also not the case ...tested theory myself....still idling EXTREMELY LOW...now i notice when i start my car that the anti lock light comes on and stays lit for a sec (which is what happened when i had the inital problem before i lost power completely) not to mention my volts are jumping back and forth when im sittin at a light indicating its still a power issue but def not the battery thats the issue...i hope this all makes sense...but basically to make long story short im still having the same issue that i was told that was fixed...and thats the issue that my 'new alternator' is not charging my brand new optima battery....and i paid 385 to potentially have my car lose power and be stuck again on the side of the road...i wish i had more positive of a review because i really like this place initially... but sadly im not happy....at all. :(\",\n",

I asked if I could at least have one of the paper towels they give out to try and wipe the bugs off. He said 'No', those were for people who bought the $5 wash. I was like really, I just paid $6 and you won't give me one. 'No, nothing I can do to help you.' REALLY?  Guess I'll just use the free vacuums and get washed elsewhere.\",\n",

Great Customer Service and timly matter to get us in and out as quick as Possible. \\n\\nWe were on our way home last night and kept hearing a thump noise, my dad thought it might had been the road, newer streets here off of Tropical and Lamb (we live in Green Valley). We head back out to finish the project today at a Rental Property and peice of the tire started comes off. . . Then another. We pulled off at Cheyenne and the Freeway where I notice the place of business. My dad went right at first, so we could check it out. Well turns out it was a Chunk of the tire tread missing. He wanted to Drive back home on the tire. . . I reccomended coming in to see what could be done. Went to the office, mentioned my situation, and was told to bring the car around to the garage. Thankfully they had a tire on hand, and changed it for us. My 12 year old was amazed by the Semi-Truck Cab getting new tires. Thank you again guys! Will be sending lots of business your way. The place is more for Commercial Vehicles but was so blessed they had a few for standard Vehicles.  Thank You, Thank you, Thank you! Keep up the Amazing work and bless you all!',\n",

I walked in to a line of desks with names on them. I stood by the front by the desk of Heidi Burns only to be ignored. Luckily I remembered I needed to speak to Joe so I found his desk while I proceeded to wait while he was with another customer. When he was done he looked up at me and said \"Are you waiting for me?\"  Serious??  How about \"How can I help you sir?\"  Probably the worst customer service at a dealership service department that I have ever witnessed. You walk in and everybody ignores you and looks at you like what are you doing here. I witnessed a customer go stand at one of the front counters needing help only to witness HEIDI BURNS ignore her and walk away. The customer then walked to another desk to get help wondering what to do. There were 3 people at desks there who ALL IGNORED HER UNTIL SHE SPOKE UP!  Nobody said \"How can I help you Ma\\'am?\" What ever happened to pure genuine customer service and caring?  Everybody here works like a zombie. Everybody seems like they hate their job and walks around without a smile. Based on the other reviews I\\'ve read on the service I would say, Mr. Brown, that you have a major problem with your service department!',\n",

I'm not trying to be mean but as a user we take these ratings seriously. I'm a mechanic myself but don't have the time to do small things like oil changes and flushes but that's why I go to Jim here at Meineke. When they talk to me, I listen first to see their point of view. Then decide from there if it's something I want to do or have Jim and his team do it instead. This location is the best out of all the meineke's in town. The other locations are owned by a different owner and I always had a bad experience with those locations except this one. Since day 1 of discovering Jim and his team, I've always had great service, great communications and Amazing timing on any type of service!!!\",\n",

One employee comes out to measure the glass after a week of me waiting, ok, fine.  2 weeks go by and no new glass.  I then call the office 4 times only to get the run around with no real answers.  By the 5th call I am told that they \"lost\" my order and they would have to come back out to re-measure.  My grumpy level was pretty high by this point.  Next day another tech comes out to measure.  My glass was completely spiderwebbed but still staying in the frame.  The tech that came out completely shattered the glass so it was all over the ground, the track, everywhere.  Did he clean it?  Oh of course not.  He also took the border frame apart and just threw them all over the ground.  In case you do not know, you have to keep them for when you re-install the glass.  And they are REALLY hard to find if you lose them.  So now I wait 2 more weeks...5 WEEKS WITH NOTHING DONE.  I call again.  3 calls with no answer.  When I finally get a hold of \"Marc\" I am told that my order is lost again and their accountant had embezzled all the money and crashed their computer system.  Paper files you ask?

Looks like you have an oil leak and some engine work that needs to be done.\" and when I asked about further info he tells me he\\'s not in the service dept do didn\\'t have all the info. WHAT? Maybe if you call a customer talking of car problems you should know what\\'s up rather than just trying to get them back in.\\n\\nI\\'m thinking, \"Oil Leak?\" - \"Engine Work?\" - Could be possible major things (since I told them I was going on a road trip), how come I wasn\\'t told when i had the car in for the oil change? Why wait almost a month to call a customer and tell them something like this? You took time to wash it - maybe give me the report.\\n\\nJust another example of either poor follow through or... a scam? Since my car runs great, good mileage, AND my garage shows no sign of any oil leak. I\\'m a simple guy, I run on facts, logic, reason and appreciate good and TIMELY service. PLUS.. within 30 minutes after my oil change i had gone to Wilhelm for some maintenance engine work and they found nothing wrong (and the work they did could NEVER have been discovered doing an oil change)\\n\\nI found myself telling the guy (nicely) i wasn\\'t happy with my last visit and I\\'d never darken their doorstep again even after I\\'d bought two cars there. Just something about this place that isn\\'t professional and smooth any more.

Maybe he had an extra or got a deal on them in bulk but either way I couldn't even have done it myself for cheaper considering shipping costs!

However, after they looked at it, they agreed and were appalled at the condition our car was returned to us. Apparently our car was the talk of the shop because all the mechanics could not believe our car was returned to us in such a way. Breather hoses left unattached, the plug in to the car computer pulled out and left dangling, and every single code on our check engine light a result of something they left undone.

First I opened the tail gate to see they didn't vacuum it at all. I told the girl about this and she was told me that she would take it over to clean up. After a very quick attempt she said she was done. I looked at her and said that she had missed several spots. I looked behind the passengers seat and the floor wasn't vacuumed there either. She said she was done and if I wanted more that I would have to pay more. I asked her if I could just finished it. So I did. Once I was done I opened all the doors to check the rest of the car. There was still water running down the doors and lots of spots. I thought that whole purpose of going to a place like this was so that when the car came out of the wash they would open the doors and wipe down all areas? I am very understanding about most things but I highly doubt I will ever come back here. Plus I certainly will tell all my friends not to stop here. Sorry Freddy's this just was not what I expected from you. You lost my business for good.\",\n",

Someone was suppose to drive my car back the day of the purchase--5 days later and I still don't have my car back. The car was suppose to be detailed. It wasn't, dirt was all over it and the driver floor mat was torn up and just thrown in the car...at this point I blame myself for even trusting this dealership to help me find a good car.\",\n",

Come to find out, the front brakes were down to nothing and should've been replaced at the oil change.  They have been replacing the EGT sensors on my F250 at no charge since buying it new in 2013 because it had a service bulletin on it.  Now, they won't honor the service bulletin and it's my responsibility.  I've only been taking it in every 7-10,000 miles because the check engine light is on, due to their inability to fix the problem on the supplier-side...but it's now my problem.  Also, because of the dealership just slapping new EGT sensors on the vehicle, the DPF system needs replaced.  This vehicle only has 124,000 miles on it.  There's no excuse to have to put $8,000 worth of repairs into it.  Peoria Ford, Ford as a manufacturer, and their service representatives are some of the worst I have seen.  They don't advise on anything.  Just fix the codes, oil changes, or tire rotations, and send the vehicles on their way. No service at all!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'So picture this:\\nA friend of mine and I rented a car for an event in Northern Nevada back in late October 2015. Upon our return, I dropped the car off after a look-through in the evening just minutes before they closed. My friend, bless her heart, decided in her unclear mind that she was going to leave her wallet in the side pocket of the passenger side door. Now, mind you, when I had dropped her off at home she was in terrible but hilarious shape. Stumbling-on-air sloshed, I mean truly wrecked. Don\\'t get me wrong, I was the friend and somehow that made me responsible for her and all of her belongings. Sooooo... I get back to the house, unaware of the oblivion I am about to walk into and she\\'s just sobbing, hysterical. Oh man.. I could feel it. This was going to be my fault. After a drawn out, slurred explanation, she says, \"You don\\'t understand. My green card is in there.\" OMG. Turns out that she had an appointment to get citizenship in just a couple weeks, a replacement card would take much longer.. You ever tried to gain citizenship without your green card? Me neither, I was born in California. Anyways, the hunt begins. Where did you see it last, when was the last time you had to show your ID, have you used your debit card, etc. Who freaking knows.\\n\\nI call everywhere. The Northern NV event venue, the bar, the Uber from the day before, everywhere. Because I thought I had checked the car pretty thoroughly, I never thought to even call. Then it dawns on me: my luck? It\\'s in the car. I call Hertz and these guys are so funny. They calm me down cracking jokes and then break the news: the car has already been rented to someone else. HAHA. Anyways, they were able to track down the person renting the car and we were lucky enough to get in contact with the renter ourselves. The people at Hertz were amazing to help us track all this stuff down, did I mention I left my garage door clicker and makeup bag in the car too? Boy, did I feel foolish.\\n\\nAnyways, long story short.. Awesome men and women running this place. They definitely know how to calm down a freaked out woman and track down missing belongings. Thank science for you, folks. Glad the universe created a few good earthlings.',\n",

They are a rip off, would not tow to my house, and I had a truck full of valuable tools, DV Towing insisted my vehicle go to the yard first so they could get the fee, and then to my house.  I refused medical treatment at the scene as to not leave my vehicle with all of my expensive tools in it.

Time after time at every dealership I went to the service was not up to par and I often felt disrespected.  What a breath of fresh air though the moment I walked into Mercedes of Chandler and was warmly greeted by Arnold.  By far, out of every single sales person I've every done business with at Porsche, Cadillac, Huffiness, and other Mercedes dealers, Arnold was 100% the best I've every worked with.  He immediately began to build a relationship with me instead of trying to sell me a car.  After I told him what I was looking for, he sat me down and write me up the exact deal that I was looking for.  In the car buying business, it is rare to find somebody who legitimately has your best interest in mind and Arnold definitely does.  After I decided on a C class, he was speedy to get the paperwork finished and ready to sign so that I could pick up my car.   Arnold possesses something that not most car salesman do and that is personality.  I consider him a consultant rather than a salesperson because he is dedicated to giving his customers the best possible experience.  I will always give my business to him in the years to come and now call him my friend.  If you're looking for a Mercedes in the the Phoenix area, give Arnold a call.  I promise you won't be disappointed.\",\n",

I told him what I was looking for, and he showed me a few vehicles that were a good fit for me. We did a test drive down the freeway, and because I still wasn't sure if the noise of the soft-top wrangler would bother me, we did another big loop. He offered me a great deal, and I felt like he was on my side. He didn't pressure me to buy the car that day. I returned the next day, and he even helped me check the inventory of other nearby dealerships to see if they had a jeep that was a closer fit to the one I wanted. He was very transparent, and I appreciated that.  \\n\\nI wasn't a huge fan of the managers I met, or the man who seemed to be rushing me through signing all the paperwork, but I liked Chris, and I love my new jeep!

       "  'text': \"DO NOT GET YOUR CAR SERVICED HERE. TAKE IT TO ANOTHER CERTIFIED LAND ROVER REPAIR SHOP. I took my car in for it's 90k mile service and inspection on June 6, 2018. They recommended I install a new drive shaft and a couple of small issues, but no other major issues.  I planned on keeping the car for a long time so I did all the work they suggested for a total of $2,742. One week after I had the car serviced the water pump failed and caused the engine to over heat. In other words I had MAJOR ENGINE FAILURE one week after having the car serviced and an additional repair bill of $2.203. It's now June 26th, 2018 and my check engine light is on. I took it to the dealership and they told me I blew a gasket head when the car over heated. I got an estimate from another repair shop for $6,500. My decision now is to have the car repaired or trade it in for it's scrap value. On June 5th, 2018 I had a perfectly fine running car with no issues, but after $5,000 in repairs and service from Land Rover Las Vegas my car is now junk. \\n\\nOn another note I brought my car in for minor service back in 2016. When the work was complete I went to pick up the car and it was leaking gas under the engine. I'm not talking a few drops of gas, but a full stream of gas was leaking from under the car. It probably leaked about 3-5 gallons in front of the dealership before they could get it to stop. I should have known how crappy their service was then and never used them again.\",\n",

Subsequent bites were enough to convince me that I will be back whenever I\\'m looking for a cheesesteak.\\n\\nThe only downer- though the gas station is always open, the Cheesesteak shop is not.

       "  'text': 'I\\'ve been a customer of their service center for the past 4 years. I\\'ve always enjoyed working with my service adviser and felt as though I was taken care of, even if there were mistakes made. During a recent call to schedule my regular oil change I was informed that they opened a new \"quick service\" center at the dealership for such services. Great! Or so I thought. Upon arrival I met my \\'new\\' service adviser for these services. Sat for over an hour and half waiting to get my oil changed?!? When my service adviser came back in to get me...nope, he was just coming to tell me all of the other things they wanted to service on the car. I had already listened to this same talk with 2 other customers sitting in the waiting area. They had not even completed my oil change yet. I understand that there is recommended maintenance work based on mileage & age of a vehicle, but why aren\\'t they letting people know up front that these are recommendations?! Waiting for 90 minutes (when I had a scheduled appointment) to find out the items, like air filters, transmission flush, etc is recommended as well, is pretty ridiculous and poor customer service.\\n\\nOne of the items recommended was a \\'transmission flush\\' which I decided was worthy of coming back for to have completed. I emailed my service adviser multiple times about the service and cost to make sure that they would be doing an actual flush and NOT just a fluid change. He assured me that it would be a flush. When I pulled up to have the service completed he informed me that this was a flush and not a service. So, just the fluids would be changed. ARGH....Seriously? This is common industry terminology folks. A fluid change and a flush are not terms that are used interchangeably. They are NOT the same service and the cost that Henry Brown Buick, GMC wanted for the actual work of a flush was no where near comparable to what other automotive centers charge. I drove away. \\n\\nNot only has my service adviser (Scott Usher) been replaced, but they have brought on new people that aren\\'t even that well versed in their own industry. Disappointing on so many levels. I like my Buick just fine, but without the option of a different dealership, located within in a reasonable distance, to work on it for warranty and basic service needs, I don\\'t think I\\'ll be keeping this vehicle anymore. \\n\\nAlthough they may think they are adding value to the customer by having this quick lube center, it has added nothing positive to my experience with this dealership\\'s service center.',\n",

       "  'text': 'I reserved and rented a one-way covered trailer from U-Haul in Champaign-Urbana, IL on University Ave on May 15th. \\n\\nThis reservation was made weeks in advance in anticipation of an out of state move that required extensive planning. (also, this weekend was graduation of a major state university located in town) I recieved a call from the location the day prior confirming my pick up time and rental. On the day of pick up - the computer system was \"down\". The employees inside ultimately told us they were not able to assign a one-way trailer without access and that they were unable to help me. No other locations nearby were open or had available trailers in any size. As advised, I contacted the general manager, Andre Hubbard, who was out of the area. \\n\\nMr. Hubbard was rude, inconsiderate, and unhelpful. He made no effort to reach a resolution. During our call - he never asked for my name, the details of my reservation, or the reservation number I had available. He made degrading and insulting remarks in my ability to understand the situation. Even after I asked specifically, he did not offer to contact anyone else in the regional area for assistance.\\n\\nWith no help or direction from Andre, I contacted the number written on the vehicle in the parking lot: 1 800 - go - Uhaul. A woman in transportation, Tammy, was immediately able to assist me and provide me a trailer assignment. \\n\\nI spent more than 3 hours waiting and delayed during my rental pick up due to the poor management and operations of this establishment. Many other customers were affected on this same day. If it was not for my own perseverance, I would have not received a trailer or continued with my plans to move. \\n\\nThe employees at the establishment were eager and willing to help. With some direction and resources provided from management, the location\\xa0\\xa0would immensely improve. It is clearly that Uhaul as a company provides great opportunity for customer care and that Andre choose not to demonstrate it.\\n\\n\\n---- I contacted UHAUL Customer Service with no response or resolution',\n",

It was taking a while, I figured that was normal. A man returned with my keys to send me on my way.\\nMy friend and I start heading out to my car, I start unlocking the door and a man with his daughter are standing their and he yells to me \"THEY DIDN\\'T TELL YOU?!\" and I said \"tell me what?\"\\nApparently the worker and THE OWNER backed my car into another car, pulled it back into the shop, and tried to buff it out.  They didn\\'t tell me about it.  And to make it even better they left my 5 speed in reverese with no e brake on once they parked it so I would roll back and it would look like MY FAULT! I went back in , obviously raging and confused, and the only person that handled it as if they actually cared abotu the business was the nice receptionist elsie.  The owners acted like it was no big deal. I couldn\\'t believe they weren\\'t even going to tell me they hit my car on another car.  They paid for it to get fixed, which is nice, and it would\\'ve been fine if they would\\'ve told me from the beginning, but all in all this place is shady and sketchy DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR THERE.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Worst service experience!!!! If you guys need to take ur vehicle to Service here steer clear of service operator CARYN!!! Tell them you want to work with someone else (I'm warning you) This one is a doozy so hold tight. \\n\\nIt all started when I brought my vehicle in for service because it was making some kind of metal grinding noise. They put me in a rental and kept my car for two days. Not one day after picking the car up after being told the car had been fixed it started making the same noise.\\n\\nWhen I brought my car back in I was assigned to Ms. Caryn as my service consultant. A few hours later she called and told me they would have to keep my car overnight. I asked when do I pick up my rental, and she basically told me they would not be doing anything to help me as far as transportation. After threatening to pick my car up from service and wanting to talk to a manager, she told me I could pick up a loaner from them before 7pm. I showed up about 630 after getting off of work to pick up my loaner. I was told that Caryn had went home early and did not bring my loaner to the front pick up area. GET THIS: the cashier handed me the key to my loaner and told me to go outside in to a parking lot full of cars ( in 110 degree vegas weather) to walk around and click the key a few times to see if anything rang!!!! After having enough and not finding the car I came in to see if I could talk to a manager and was told that he had left for the day. So they had a guy from the back bring the loaner around. \\n\\nThe next day I waited the whole day to hear back about my vehicle. Knowing that hey closed  at 7pm, I called in at 5pm to get an update. They told me that Ms. Caryn did not came in to work that day. I asked who was taking care of my vehicle in her absence, and they told me they would call me back in 30 minutes. Almost an hour and a half later after no one calling me back I called in and they had to admit that no one had looked at my vehicle that day. I was livid!!!!! They assigned me to another service consultant and he took care of my issues from there on. I will never take my vehicle back here. NOTHING BUT A HEADACHE DO NOT WORK WITH CARYN (you have been warned).\",\n",

I had previously been at another place where they had messed my car up and didn't take responsibility for their lack of knowledge. Anyway, the reason I am leaving a review here is due to the treatment of Sean and Becca. They were very good at explaining things in layman's  terms. They were very patient and I felt that they truly wanted to help me with my automobile. The  lobby was very nice, and I felt that the people there were honest and trust worthy. I would return here again due to Becca's  customer service skills. Plus, I simply trust having a woman working on my car. She looked me straight in the eye and I could tell that she cared. Again, they calmed my stress and made feel comfortable with everything. This type of treatment is rare today. I was treated the way everyone wants to be treated; when it comes to getting your car serviced. They even printed out information for changing my battery in the future on my Lexus. Thank you !\",\n",

Of course, they offered the service at a costly price.  Being that I am a bargain shopper, I went ahead and checked out Groupon and just searching.  As always, find out the best on Yelp.  Best prices and the reviews with 5 stars, can't argue with that!!!  \\n\\nSean was able to come by, even though I wasn't home.  I know what you are thinking, have someone I just met into my garage when no one is home?  I thought so too, but he is very trustworthy.  Gave me the breakdown on what needed to be done and what it would cost for additional work.  Of course, I just chose to do the minimal in hopes to save some cash.  After about an hour, I texted Sean to say go ahead and wax it for the additional cost.  10 minutes later, talked with Sean and he said we were all done.  Again, gave me the breakdown of why the grease wouldn't wash out, how he got it out, and how to take care going forward.  \\n\\nGot home later on that day to find the car in spectacular condition.  Buffed, waxed, and vacuumed!!!  Sean left the invoice on the car but he only charged me for the buff.  Not the wax or the internal cleaning...of course I got the thumbs up from the wife and they have now a lifetime customer for all my car cleaning needs.  Don't hesitate to call.  Wish I could have taken a before picture as the now picture would not do it justice.\",\n",

I called at 6:05pm thinking they must close at 7 and I need my vehicle. Man said service people all left 5 minutes ago. They could call me first thing in morning and tell me the status of my vehicle. I remembered a phone call earlier in day where I answered, hello, hello, hello but heard a series of electronic clicks. Nothing. It happened again. Same exact thing. So at 6:10pm I called that number back and it was Peoria Ford. I guess that was their attempt to call!?!  So Goodbye to Peoria Ford and hello to Sanderson Ford!! Go with your gut, I didn't!\",\n",

I have no previous tinting experience to compare with)   Anyways I originally received a little postcard on my windshield at my local smiths advertising this place.  So I dropped by a week later to get an estimate and see what product they offered.  The Owner Brian was pleasant and showed me all my options and helped explain the workings of his product seeing as how I told him I was a newbie.   Anyways I left there and then called back a couple times the next week and Brian answered each time which was cool and made me feel more comfortable knowing I had a direct connection with the owner.  Needless to say he set me up with an appointment and when I showed up I just chilled in their waiting room and watched some videos on my phone.  The lady at the front desk was nice and as I waited other people came in and out asking their questions which she was able to answer fully.   All in all I was there maybe an hour and a half and my car was done.  She then explained what I should expect and also some directions for the next few days while the tint did its thing to adhere.   Its been 2 days since the install and the windows look great.   Overall I'm pleased so far and can now hopefully not be broiled this summer while driving.\",\n",

We were told one thing, how much the down payment w I'll be how much our monthly payments would be, and when we finally actually came, they told us something different. We got bait and switched. Tyler was off the day we came in so The salesman who helped us, Nico, helped us for a little bit and while looking at the vehicles, he literally then told us he can't help us anymore because he had an appointment to attend to, then had told a trainee who was just shadowing,  that he can take over and if he can find the keys to the vehicle then we can test drive it. We were told all different things. We showed them texts of the sale men telling us the prices of finance and that we were approved and to come down. Customer service was horrible, they were rude, unprofessional and didn't care. They had about 5 different people come talk to us. Why does it take that many people? They wasted almost 3 hours of our time. We were told by Thor who is a sales manager that he would contact us the next day around 115pm when another worker who we spoke to as well named Matt came in so they can resolve the issue and know what's going on. 115pm came, nobody had contacted us. So we call around 2pm and spoke to the General Manager and he tells us that he's going to work on it and get back to us. We still haven't heard back from them and it's been about a week now. They ran my credit 4 times!!!!!! Two times before we came in, once when we came in and even days after we came in and still, the issue has not been resolved! Horrible dealership.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'This place is completely incompetent. I\\'ve been trying to get a trailer hitch installed so I can attach a bike rack for three weeks. \\n\\nEvery time you call you get rolled over to the call center and they try to answer questions and they have no idea what you\\'re talking about. \\n\\nI finally went online and ordered the hitch. They make you pay for it 100% up front so they have you over a barrel because they already have your money. They ask you online to pick a day for install and then they say someone will call you to make the appointment on that day.\\n\\nNo one called me, instead I received a text and an email saying that my appointment for my install is at 7:00am. This is fine but it\\'s in Saturday, the day I picked. But who wants to get up at 6am on their day off to get a hitch installed. But whatever. Go early and get it over with right?\\n\\nSo I drag myself out of bed at 6am Saturday, drive the 10 miles to get there, wait in line with all of the other people with 7am appointments (they open at 7 so that\\'s when the doors open and everyone arrives), and 15 mins later finally get to a cashier. \\n\\nI tell her I have a hitch appt and give her my name. She looks me up and says ok at 9 when the guy gets here he can do your hitch. \\n\\nAT 9:00?!?!?!\\n\\nThen why on earth did you schedule me at 7?!?!?  So I showed her the text and the email. She said oh that\\'s from the call center. We open at 7 but they guy isn\\'t here until 9. Then how come the email I got is signed by someone, \"Sabrina Mills\" from the Decatur location with the Decatur address and phone info?  \\n\\nThe email and text plain as both day say 7am. \\n\\nSo I tell her that since I\\'ve already paid there\\'s nothing I can do because they already have my money. So I\\'ll now have to go home and come back. She asks if I\\'m gonna leave the vehicle. No. How can I leave the vehicle? I have to drive it home. \\n\\nSo I drove the 10 miles back home where I am now sitting here writing this. And in an hour I have to get up again and drive the 10 miles back and waste more gas and more of my time on Saturday for something that should be easy. \\n\\nMy advice if you schedule an appointment there, call and make them transfer you and talk to someone there directly and verify your appointment.  Because apparently they don\\'t really know what they are doing.',\n",

       "  'text': \"This review does have a happy ending...really.\\n\\nLast Monday I decided I needed new tires for my car. After a little online shopping I decided on Discount Tire and gave them a call. Since I was heading out of town Tuesday and Wednesday I made an appointment for Thursday at 8:00 AM.\\n\\nI arrived about 40 minutes late, but had called ahead to let them know and when they checked me in they said it wasn't a problem. After asking for the car to be done by noon and being assured it would be ready I was on my way back to the office.\\n\\n12:30 PM comes and I gave the store a call to confirm the car was ready and was told it was all set. I had one of my friends come and give me a ride to Discount Tire. \\n\\nI usually don't check the work, but today something struck me to take a look at the car before I went inside. Low and behold the car hadn't moved since I dropped it off in the morning. I went inside and stood in line and when I was finally waited on I brought the situation to their attention. \\n\\nUnfortunately I needed my car for afternoon appointments and couldn't wait any longer even though they offered to get it in right away and get it done in 15 minutes.\\n\\nI left the store extremely upset as I had planned on leaving on vacation the next day and was out of time to get the tires. When I got back to the office I decided to give them a call and wound up speaking to an Assistant Mgr. \\n\\nUltimately he offered to pick up my car and bring it back to me which was the best solution they could have offered. I really appreciated it.\\n\\nBefore this experience I would have given Discount Tire 4 or 5 stars and in the end they made it right. I just wish they would have done the work when they were supposed to.\",\n",

They drive slow like old ladies, are endlessly confused about traffic, and gobble up precious beach parking spaces that should otherwise go to tax-paying San Diego residents! I won\\'t even get started on their white, gross bodies. What else does that desert hell have to offer us here? The manufacturer and management of RED LIGHT CAMERAS! Yes, that is right, ATS is the ARIZONA company that runs the City of San Diego\\'s Red Light Camera show! Another SLAP IN THE FACE  to San Diego FROM Cactus-ville!\\n\\nThe City of San Diego Traffic website states: \"To adequately enforce traffic signal laws, we use red light photo enforcement. Police officers cannot be everywhere at once.\" The City strategically mentions this also: \"The (Red Light Photo System) RLPS system is a technology that records serious traffic violations the moment they occur. Cameras are used to photograph only vehicles that run red lights in targeted areas. Officers then review the film and a traffic citation is then issued to the vehicles\\' registered owner through the mail.\" \\n\\nNow I have been to Traffic Court trying to get out a ticket (not Red Light) and I have seen the anger and rage that these Red Light tickets bring out in otherwise normal people. In fact, most of the cases that I witnessed in Traffic Court were offenses related to camera tickets. They are very controversial. Most of the thugs that live at my apartment complex simply take off (or cover up) their front license plates to remove the threat of a photo ticket. Why? The cost of the citation in San Diego varies, based on your driving record. Citations for running a red light are a minimum of $480. They are a hassle to fight and some require the services of a lawyer-another negative point against ATS!\\n\\nI offer only 2 YELP STARS for this program because, although the intentions are honorable, (to prevent traffic accidents) there are still too many problems and questions still associated with this program. I am all for doing things to stop bad drivers from causing accidents but a lot of them manage to slip through the system.  ATS is just another Arizona scam to come out of the Great State of Hotter than Hell to bite San Diegans on their (toned & tanned) rears!',\n",

All of them stared at looking crazy except for one....Arnold Lim. He was friendly, funny, and moved fast....he makes the car buying process extremely smooth and pleasant. The vehicle i chose was incredible and I got a great deal on it too. Arnold and his manager, I believe his name was Gavin were just really nice people.I wasn't pressured and they listened to what I had to say. Mr.Jose the Finance guy was pretty cool too. Overall my experience was really great! I walked in there with a basic vehicle and came back out in something very classy. Thank you!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"So, I thought I was a mechanic. Do this. Unbolt this. Break the tab off that panel. Throw a wrench. Etc.\\n\\nSo, I undertook replacing my A/C compressor.\\n\\nI did it. However, replacing any part of the A/C system is more than a simple plug-and-play. The line needs to be cleaned, evacuated, leak checked, and then finally charged.\\n\\nPeople who do this for a living have some pretty spiffy equipment to help them do this. All which is, of course, pretty expensive.\\n\\nSo, I physically replaced my compressor... but still needed all the other stuff done too. Great. Enter ADS.\\n\\nThey actually needed to remove the compressor to see if it had oil in it or if they needed to add some. So really, they redid all my work. Again, great, I oculd have saved myself some wrench throwing if they were going to do it all over again.\\n\\nBut, it's done. It cost me ~$650, which was half of what my main shop wanted... and it runs. By brother also had his condenser replaced... and it cost him about the same after parts.\\n\\nMoral of this story - don't mess with A/C repair unless you have the equipment.\",\n",

I had quotes from 3 different shops including the dealer and 25th Street Automotive was the most inexpensive. But price was not the only thing that made 25th a great experience. They were honest and thorough from my first call until I left with my truck fixed. They gave me a ride to work, made sure to cover my seats and floor with plastic to keep it clean and were sure to explain all that they saw while working on the truck. The owner thanked me for my business and was polite enough to ask for future business in a genuine and polite manner that made me feel as if he was truly looking to make a life-time customer. To top it all off the total price was slightly less than initially quoted.\\n\\nThey are the BEST automotive repair experience I have had in the 10 years I have lived in the valley.

I have bought the coupon books for as many years as I've been coming. They were for the best wash as it was the same price for the hand wash. Two weeks after I bought my last coupon book they raised the price to $50 for the hand wash. They would take two coupons for the same hand wash but offer no refund for the difference. To make matters worse they wouldn't even wash my mats to make up the difference. The icing on the cake came today as I drove to the hand wash bay as I have done every weekend the guy tells me to walk over the booth and pay. I told him that I don't go through the drive and that I pay inside. I went through the drive the very first time and curbed my wheel. The turn radius is too tight if your not going through the tunnel. I explained this to the guy cleaning my car. The girl in the booth through her hands in the air and was completely out of line. Amazing the amount of money I have spent at this location and to be treated the way I was today unbelievable!\\n\\nThere appears to be a lack of management at this location. It shows in the quality of their work. In the past management made an effort to get to know you and your car. They were always walking around looking at the work being done. This is definitely not the case anymore. I will be reaching out to the corporate office as well. I sure hope they get their act together!\",\n",

I Was honest and clearly stated several times to the salesman we had no intention of purchasing a car that day.  After hearing the \"what will it take to get you to buy it today\" speech we told the salesman we weren\\'t buying today and he insisted on giving us a price anyway. We sat through the sales pitch and told him we would get back to him in a few months when we were actually ready to purchase.   Pleasant so far.....All was well until a few days later when in the middle of a busy work day I get a call. The salesman asks if I was ready to bring my trade in to get a trade in value. I explained again I wasn\\'t interested and not even sure I was trading it in. Thats when the \"car salesman\" came out.  I was berated for not bringing my truck in to get a value, told it was unheard of to actually test drive a car I wasn\\'t interested in immediately purchasing, had my words twisting and thrown back in my face. Overall, one of the most unpleasant non car buying experiences I have had and I currently own 3 new cars.  I would most likely have purchased a car from them before the tongue-lashing.

After my car exited the automated wash it sat for an hour before someone finally touched it. Then at two hours I decided to tell the cashiers that i was unhappy with the wait. The cashier brushed me off and said thanks for telling us. Then after two and a half hours my car still isn't done I decided I needed to talk to a manager. At this point I'm extremely upset after watching one of the people attending my car walk off and chat with a guy who pulled up in a supped up honda and decided to chat for a few minutes. So I spoke with a manager who went and check on my vehicle and told me it was just about done. I then asked him how I get the fifty cents off a gallon for gas. He said normally you have to pay for the car wash at the pump but he would get it for me. So they pull my car to the pump. I now have to lug my baby into the cashier to ask how to pay to get the fifty cents off. She tells me pay outside and come back in. I do this then head back in with baby in tow to get my refund. This cashier tells me I need my receipt to prove I paid for the car wash. So I had to go back out to the car and get the receipt and then back in. At this point I am so fed up with the service I turn in my club card I had just signed up for and advised the cashier I wouldn't be coming back.  Not to mention when I looked over my car after this I saw a lot os spots left untouched. \\n\\nThere was a day when companies cared what their customers thought and tried to make right on their errors.

       "  'text': \"Update 1/26/16: Apparently the business is under new ownership and so far they are not off to a great start.  I brought in my truck (I hand wash/2 bucket method my other vehicles) and was immediately thrown off (not knowing ownership had changed) when new costs were added to the price.  $10 for mud removal (okay the truck was muddy) but then another $3 for excessive dirt...umm you're a car wash?  The truck was muddy as I took it off-road, but it's not the first time and the previous owners always took care of it without any up-charges.  If the car came out just as clean as it used to I probably wouldn't be writing any update to this (previously 4 star review), but instead I found the roof to be dirty and the driver side had numerous swirl marks and a few minor scratches (and no this didn't happen off-roading - there was no mud in this area and I inspect the truck daily...I noticed this as soon as I got home and parked it after the wash).  There are many water marks, the tire spray and interior dressing all appear to have worn off in less than 24 hours and there is over-spray on the fenders.  It does not appear that quality cleaning products are used and either they are not using the correct non-abrasive cleaning cloths or used at least one after it fell on the ground.  Sadly I will now have to go back to N. Scottsdale 20 minutes away to get a quality hand-wash.\\n\\nPrior Owner 4 star Review: Ever since Big J closed up his physical location and went mobile I have been struggling to find a proper car wash facility.  As someone who only hand washes my vehicles it is difficult to find a good hand car wash at a reasonable price.  There are some really great detail shops in N. Scottsdale, but most operate by appointment only (which is why I generally don't use mobile services) and can be a little pricier.  Stewart Detailing is the first true hand wash and dry I have found that is in my area, reasonably priced and seems to perform a very good wash.  The only thing I have noticed is the bug cleaning on the front is not a thorough as it should be and I tend to finish the job when I get home.  I have used them four times now with my vehicle and each wash was as good as the last.  They also have a dog wash on premise which I have not utilized yet, but is a pretty good idea and allows customers to do something productive while they wait.  They have a shaded sitting area and two indoor sitting areas, one where customers can view their vehicle being washed which is conducted indoors and another where customers have a view of their vehicle being dried and detailed.  I like being able to keep an eye on my car.\\n\\nThe staff has been very friendly and took no issue with my occasional request to clean a specific area more thoroughly such as my carpeted truck bed.   Overall I am very happy with the quality of their work and will continue to use them.\",\n",

My Girlfriend Audrey, her son and 2 friends were on our way to Las Vegas in the BMW and got a low tire warning on our dashboard around 6:10pm.

By the time we rolled into Boulder City it was getting really load and it was on its last mile or so.

To her surprise someone was in there still working on some paperwork, his name was Craig. Craig let us know that he would not be able to fix the tire until the next day due to no one there to do the work. We explained our predicament to him and he offered to take us to our hotel on Fremont St. You want to talk about a packed car, our entire luggage and 6 people.

I'm so happy I went with Chapman Hyundai. I called to check my warranty status and they were able to fit me in with an appointment quickly. They needed to order a part for my car so they set me up with a rental while my car was fixed. The next day my car was fixed but I was at work til after the service shop closed. Justin set it up so I could pick up the car after hours. Pickup was seamless and I was greeted in my car by a cute ribbon tied box full of candy. Great, efficient service by this service shop\",\n",

They told me i needed this and I needed that, OK FINE I'll get it, cause the honest truth is I don't take as good of care of my car as I should. I knew they were full of it because when they went over everything on the car that was fine, they said my windshield whippers and I for a fact know that I've needed to replaced them for the last 2 years (and still haven't). Which makes me question them because if they're trying to get their moneys worth, wouldn't they at least check that out? So maybe they just tell everyone the same thing and try and rip you off. So I won't go here again and I'll heed my boyfriends nagging and let him decide where to get it changed and use as many coupons as he wants.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'WARNING DONT GO TO THIS SHOP. This is literally THE WORST car shop I have been to. (I would give negative stars but yelp doesn\\'t allow that) I went in yesterday for a very simple total oil change. They do the oil, filter, tire rotation, top off fluids, etc. instead of the express where it\\'s just the oil and filter. I had a stripped drain plug when they went back after the oil change, which meant I needed a new one. Totally fine. They didn\\'t have the part, so the front desk guy went over to their closet shop to get another. Perfect, convenient, thanks for doing that for me. BUT NO. Instead of getting the right size they tried to use a size bigger, crammed it into the drain hole, and ended up cracking the entire oil pan. I found this out the next morning when I woke up to low oil and oil all over my front drive. Now, I called and told them and took it in. They inspected my car and found in fact, the tech did crack my oil pan and they would have to cover all costs to fix that and give me another oil change. Took them about an hour to figure that out. Told me it would take about 3 hours to get the pan, replace all the parts, and put in new oil. IT ACTUALLY took 5 and a half hours. No regard for the fact that they told me it would be three and I had plenty of other things to get done today. I called three times during the day and no one could tell me a real estimate, no one could tell me why it was taking so much longer. \\n\\nNot only was it a bad oil change and they have bad techs not paying attention, they gave me estimates for brake replacements that I absolutely do not need, and told me I was 5k miles over replacing my timing belts (not a small job) when in fact I was 5k UNDER and still had time to worry about getting it done. They were trying to hassle me out of my money and do a shotty job (because I\\'m a young women \"who doesn\\'t know better\"). \\n\\nAbsolutely worst shop I have been to for what I thought was going to be an easy, 45 minute oil change. Save your time, worry, and money and DO NOT GO HERE.',\n",

However, the overall experience was pretty abysmal and we will definitely not be back. \\n\\nFirst of all, the entire establishment is a hot mess: there\\'s no comfortable place for customers to sit and wait unlike many other reputable car washes in the area, they don\\'t quote accurate times or honor appointments, you have no idea where to go/pull in when you get there, and with the exception of one excellent employee, I found them to be pretty rude and disagreeable overall. \\n\\nI purchased a \"group deal\" for myself for a full detail and a gift deal for my husband for just a wash. We took both our cars super early one Saturday morning and they were not terribly busy at the time. I left mine because it was the hardest/longest job and told them we wanted my husband\\'s washed when we returned to get my car. Just a switch out, simple enough. They agreed and we ran some errands. \\n\\nWe went back at the time they quoted to pick my car up and they would not take my husband\\'s car in for a wash for 4 hours. The car wash is not conveniently located to where we live and I went there based on reputation, so imagine my disappointment when they went back on what they had told us earlier. \\n\\nNone of the employees could decide whether or not they could squeeze us in sooner and kept bickering about it. They finally told us that we needed to make an appointment and come back. Sorry, but I\\'m pretty sure that\\'s what we discussed 3 hours ago when it was agreed we were coming back to have the other car washed - not detailed - just washed. \\n\\nUnfortunately, we got busy with upcoming holidays and work schedules and my husband\\'s voucher expired last week. It\\'s still good for the amount I paid, but it isn\\'t worth the drive over there. They can consider that a tip since I was so frustrated at the time of my service I forgot to tip them.',\n",

       "  'text': 'It\\'s been a hell of an experience trying to trade in my 2008 F150 over the past two weeks...  I\\'ve walked out on five other deals throughout that period due to shady salesmen who must think that consumers cannot do research on cars nowadays.  That is until I began speaking with Paul Ray over at Peoria Ford.  \\n\\nPaul contacted me after filling out an internet appraisal for my truck.  By the way, I call my truck Clifford since he was big and red.  Anywho...  I filled out my internet appraisal for Clifford and within two hours I had a phone call from Paul over at the dealership.  I told Paul what I was in the market for (2014 Edge Sport in White or Red).  Almost immediately Paul had emailed me with price quotes on the cars they had in stock.  I had already been quoted a better price by a dealership in Tucson, but Paul assured me that Peoria Ford could beat their price by at least $500 or they would pay me $1000.  Throughout the week I kept in contact with Paul, and on Sunday morning (07-27-2014) I made the trek from Chandler all the way out to Peoria.   \\n\\nUpon arriving at the Ford dealer I met with Paul and he immediately showed me the white Ford Edge I had been looking at.  After inspecting it, we agreed to sit down and talk numbers.  Paul was able to get me $750 more on my trade than the dealership in Tucson was offering as well as just about the same price on the Edge which had one more option (Vista Sunroof).  \\n\\nIn the end Paul and I came to an agreement on the price of the car, and I was signing paperwork before I could even figure out what was going on.  Even the finance guy in the dreaded \"box\" was easy to work with and got me a great deal on the offered service plan.  I mean, $60 per year which covers all oil changes???  At $100 a pop for oil changes, that\\'s a no brainer.  \\n\\nSo after signing all of the paperwork, I just hung out and waited for my new car to be detailed up.  After it was ready to roll, I met with Kat, or Cat... I\\'m not sure how she spells it, but here\\'s your shout out \"Whoop Whoop!!\"  I hope you win your contest...  Anywho, she was great and showed me how to use the Myford Touch system and Sync.  She was also great with a camera, and hopefully I can make the customer calendar haha!    \\n\\nOverall, I left with a new car, and an extremely manageable car payment.  Peoria Ford has definitely earned my future business!  Thanks to everyone I worked with yesterday, I couldn\\'t be happier with my new car.  Y\\'all rock.',\n",

       "  'text': 'BUYER BEWARE!!!  This dealership is full of liars and cheaters!  I could list the names of the incompetent people I have encountered here.  There is a severe lack of communication within both the sales and service departments.  One one occasion, the salesman excused himself to greet another customer and to get keys for a test drive but never returned.  I returned a different day and asked for a different salesman.  This proved to be a mistake.  When I decided to finance with an outside credit union, I was told Cochran would not and did not run my credit since they could not compete with the rate I got.  Cochran ran my credit not once, but twice thereby decreasing my credit score by over 50 points for the multiple hits.  The sales department backtracked on the negotiations that were agreed to.  Promises were broken and they continued to lie through their teeth rather than admitting they were wrong or could not accommodate. This dealership only listens to half of what you say.  I asked for a kayak rack but only received the holders (not the crossbars).  The complete system (crossbars and holders) is the only option available on the main website under accessories.  Phone calls / emails are not returned.  Decals are not applied correctly causing unnecessary trips back to the service department where I find yet another a new service manager and crew that I have to explain my situation to all over again.  It is not worth the frustration or hassle to deal with this dealership...go elsewhere!',\n",

       "  'text': 'Very disappointing! My family and I visited a large number of dealerships over the course of two weeks and Horne Kia was by far the worst!\\n\\nI had been helping my sister shop for a new car and I came across a vehicle on Horne Kia\\'s website that was the specific model and trim level I really wanted her to see.  It was listed on the Horne Kia website at $4,000 more than an identical car (same year/model/color/trim) listed at another dealer nearby, so I called ahead and spoke with \"Mike\".\\n\\nWe discussed the other, identical car and he said he \"might not be able to match the price of the competitor\\'s car exactly\", but he promised he could \"get really close\".  I explained that I had to make arrangements with my sister and didn\\'t want to make the drive clear across town if he wasn\\'t absolutely certain that he could get very close to the competitor\\'s price.  He said \"no problem, we can make it happen\" and told me to come on in.\\n\\nI gathered my sister, my father and my wife and drove across town to see the vehicle.  Mike was there when we arrived, but he immediately handed us off to another salesperson, Eric, as Mike was helping someone else (even though I had informed him that we were on our way).\\n\\nWe took the test drive and my sister absolutely loved the car, as I expected.  Interested in the car, we went inside to talk numbers.\\n\\nThey started the \"deal\" at a higher price than was listed on the car!  I was a little put off by this, but it was the first round of negotiations, so I patiently explained the situation to Eric.  He left and returned a while later with an updated offer.  This time at FULL sticker price!  I said that obviously wasn\\'t going to do.  He got a little sharp with us, but I made it clear we didn\\'t want to play games, so he left again.  \\n\\nAfter another wait, he returned with the dealership\\'s \"Best Offer\".  The result? A discount of just $75.  I was as much confused as I was offended.\\n\\nI again referred to the conversation with Mike and explained that a mere $75 discount on a $24,000 car was almost an insult. Eric said they couldn\\'t do any better.  I explained that I was disappointed as we really liked the car and had hoped for better.  We got up from the table, shook Eric\\'s hand and I informed him that we were going to leave. I asked for a manager\\'s card before I left, which he then left to get.  \\n\\nHe made us wait a substantial amount of time, likely to see if we would leave on our own without the manager\\'s card.  However, we continued to wait.  When he finally returned, instead of bringing the manager\\'s card, he brought Mike.  \\n\\nMike proceeded to confront us about the failed sale.  He changed what he had said, suggested that we didn\\'t know how things work (I\\'ve helped friends and family buy more than 20 cars from dealerships...I know how it works) and even went so far as to claim I was making up most of the conversation we had earlier that day!  My father became upset, as he had been sitting with me when I made the call to Mike and had overheard the entire thing.  \\n\\nI reminded Mike that the only reason I had made arrangements for all of us to come down and endured the drive was because of what he had told me on the phone and I wasn\\'t interested in arguing, we just wanted to leave.  \\n\\nUnable to accept fault to any degree, Mike persisted.  Every time he opened his mouth, it made us feel less appreciated.\\n\\nI stated that we had been looking forward to making a deal that day and I didn\\'t understand why they would approach us like this as we were leaving.  He was spending more time butting heads with us than trying to keep us as customers!  \\n\\nI finally got tired of the circular conversation and informed him and Eric (again) that we were leaving.  My sister and my wife, frustrated and unhappy, had already gone to wait in my car.  I again asked Eric for the manager\\'s card.  Eric and Mike left.\\n\\nOnce again, instead of going and getting the manager\\'s card for me, Eric returned empty handed, this time with the sales manager, Anthony, in tow.  \\n\\nAnthony was pleasant, but I had to try and stay calm as I explained our position on the deal a third time.  Anthony said Mike shouldn\\'t have made promises he couldn\\'t keep and said he\\'d have a talk with Mike regarding his conduct, but I\\'m not convinced anything happened after we left.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, the damage had been done and the four of us left VERY emotional and distraught.  If we had been allowed to leave when the deal first went south, we would simply have been disappointed and this might be a 3-star review.\\n\\nSimply put, this should have been an exciting and positive interaction, particularly for my sister who was genuinely looking forward to buying a car that day, but it degraded to become the worst dealership interaction we experienced in our search.\\n\\nIf you want to feel appreciated as a customer, I can assure you that there are many dealerships around the valley who make that their priority.  Unfortunately, Horne Kia isn\\'t one of them.\\n\\nAvoid if you can!',\n",

       "  'text': 'On 5/24/2013 I purchased a vehicle at Wilde East Towne Honda in Madison. My sales professional Jose Diaz-Caballero did an awesome job selling me the car, but once the deal was out if his hands that\\'s where my entire experience went south. I came in at noon to test drive a vehicle. I really enjoyed the car, and it was exactly what I was looking for. Jose sold me on and the price was right. I said I would take it depending in what they would offer me for my trade. They took my car keys and sat me at Jose\\'s desk for 45 minutes. I was on my lunch break and needed to get back to work, but alas I couldn\\'t leave as they had my keys. I finally found my car and keys and went back to work. I had explained to Jose that I would be financing thru my own credit union and already had that arranged. I asked him to get the paperwork ready, I would come by and sign it then go to my CU and pick up the check and come back with it. I also explained that I had stuff to do after work and didn\\'t have time to be waiting around for delivery. Jose understood. He finally gets back to me at close to 4pm and tells me that his manager said the deal is contingent on me financing thru the dealership (one of the banks they deal with), and that I have to finance thru them on order to buy a car! I said what if I pay cash and they say No, I have to finance thru them, that\\'s it. I reluctantly agree as it is Friday getting close to 5pm and my CU will be closing. I head back to work and close up and come back to the dealership expecting this to wrap up quickly. Instead I sit and wait till 530pm when Peter Bothe from the Finance Department finally comes and goes over the deal with me. He explains they\\'ve found me financing (I already had my own, thank you) and their rate is 6% higher than the rate from my credit union. I tell them this is ridiculous to sell the car to someone else. I go outside, and realize that Jose, my salesman, shouldn\\'t have to lose a sale just because of the attitude of management. I used to sell cars so I understand how that goes. I went back in and Peter Wisnewski (sales manager) came and talked to me explained that \"this is how they do things\" and that \"the deal is contingent upon me taking their financing.\" He then tells me that they are giving me the \"opportunity\" to buy a car from them. Oh what an honor!! Peter Wisnewski next told me that I won\\'t get a better value anywhere else or as much for my trade-in, however they were matching what another dealership (Zimbrick BMW) had previously offered me. I decided to go ahead with their financing and set up a refinance the next business day with my Credit Union. My sales person Jose did offer me free car washes to try to redeem the dealership, which is appreciated. While I was waiting at Jose\\'s desk, Emily, another sales person, came up to me an appologized for the games the management was playing with me, and she even helped me gather my belongings from my trade. She was very helpful and sweet, and really helped to diffuse my anger.  \\n\\nI have previously used the Service Department at Wilde East Towne Honda and dealt with Cheryl Batease who was simply wonderful. If you have to have service done at Wilde I would recommend working with Cheryl. I also recommend Jose and Emily as sales professionals, but I wouldn\\'t recommend buying a vehicle from this dealership based on my experience with the Finance Department and the Sales Manager\\'s attitudes towards customers and that they would not allow me to use my own financing.',\n",

I was never given the key so it makes it terribly inconvenient at times.\\n\\nAnywho, I took my car in to get an oil change, have my tires and brakes checked and to get a general vehicle inspection. Once they did the inspection he came back with recommendations, one of them being my engine's air filter. Rather than just tell me it needed to be changed he had it with him to show me, which I liked, you just never know and he was definitely being honest about it. It was dirty! I could tell that my tires were bad, but apparently my brakes were left at 1-2mm (which I was told is not good). They have never been checked or serviced for the 8+ years I've had the car though, (I know, I know) so it wasn't that big of a shock to me. The guy who helped me was very thorough and explained everything to me in detail that I needed and what it would cost, etc. and the dangers or problems I could have if I didn't get it done.\\n\\nIt was going to cost upwards of $1100 bucks for everything so I told him I wanted to sleep on it to decide what I was going to do. He didn't pressure me at all, but just informed me that I should take care of it as soon as possible so that I'm not driving an unsafe vehicle. He printed everything out for me that they were recommending as well as pricing so I could go over it. \\n\\nI decided that evening that I would go back in the next day or two to have the tires and brakes done. When I got there to drop my car off it was a quick and easy process and there were no sudden changes or surprises. Everything was taken care of and they didn't try to recommend anything else or up sell me. They did call me about my tire sensors because they are broken, but that's understandable.\\n\\nOnce I got back to pick up my car it was, again, quick and easy. Everything went great and I haven't had any problems with my car. In fact, it is now easier to drive and a more smooth ride. I'm especially not fighting steering anymore because they fixed my alignment, too.\\n\\nThe entire process was pleasant and service was great! I would definitely go back to this location.\",\n",

I have a 2017 Subaru WRX that I had them paint and install a front lip spoiler on. After about six months the spoiler started peeling and flaking on its own. I contacted platinum paint and body they told me to come in and they would take a look at it. When I came in the owner Alfredo was not available so I had a lady take some pictures and take my information and they told me they would call me. Two weeks later I still have no phone call so I called them only to get a voicemail. I left them a message with my name and number and asked for a callback. Two days goes by and still no phone call. I finally called them this morning and was told to contact Alfredo directly because they are too busy to give callbacks. When I contacted Alfredo he told me that my part isn't a good part and that he doesn't like to paint those and that I should take it off my car and send it back to the manufacturer. I asked him why he didn't tell me this at the beginning and he tells me that I was only leasing the car and didn't need it to last long. I told Alfredo I leased the car for three years not for six months. Conversation ended when he told me to take the part off and send it back to the manufacturer. I will never use platinum paint and body again and will never recommend them to anybody else. I will however let people know what happened if asked. Stay away from Platinum Paint and Body is my recommendation.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'My Car had a leak and started slow. I paid $1100 for this to be fixed and they were not. I took a day off work to have my car repaired at Keffer. It HAS an oil leak and IS starting sluggish. They quoted $1133.40 to do a fuel line flush and to fix the leak. After having the repairs completed and paying I went to my car where it did not start...still on the lot! We went inside and they said we could leave it but since I have to work for a living that was not an option. Friday was the earliest I could return. Wednesday I get up for work and low and behold there is oil on the ground, Thursday fresh oil on the ground, Friday fresh oil on the ground. Justin had called and said that they would have a loaner car there and ready for me. When I arrive Curtis seems to know nothing about this and we end up being there for 35 minutes and he then says we have to fill it back up to where it was on gas or we will be charged $6 a gallon. Um, no considering if the job was done correctly the first time I wouldn\\'t need a loaner car and I\\'m already burning up my gas running back and forth to Huntersville from Concord. So Curtis eventually calls telling us that it needs a fuel pump and that it will be $580 and that they can\\'t find a leak and think it\\'s just \"excess oil\". This is unacceptable. So we speak with Justin who first offers us a $150 credit then a $220 credit. Really? We just paid for $1100 worth of services we didn\\'t need and we are expected to pay another $360 to $580 in charges again to MAYBE get the job right this time? Then when I go into the service department to pick up my car, I am in the middle of speaking with Curtis and a salesman comes running in and rudely cuts off our conversation so he can say \"I\\'m about to sell this car can you have it ready by 5?\" Really? I\\'ve already wasted 2 days here and now I have to waste another 10minutes because this rude salesman can\\'t wait his turn? From the first time I drove a Jetta I loved it. All of the people I encountered had been great and I always said I would drive nothing other than a VW and my teenagers 1st car would be a VW but after this experience my opinion has drastically changed about VW. This will be my LAST VW. I want nothing to do with the service department and anything period with VW. We have a mechanic that we know and trust but I wanted to take my car to a VW Service department and what I feared happened....I was screwed out of my $1100 and my car still doesn\\'t function properly',\n",

I told them I was there to pick up the car, they had me wait. wait, wait, and wait. I went to ask about my car and they had me wait some more because they didn't have the work order for it, so I couldn't even pay for it. I was there for at least 2 more hours. It was so frustrating.  Why did I have to be running around trying to find a work order to pay for this???  even after the car was done, nobody bothered on letting me know. They were in no hurry to help me get out of there!. I was so Mad! \\n\\nI had taken the car there before for  regular car wash, and they never do a good job.  The only reason I went back for other car wash its because my husband got me the 10 car wash booklet. Which I suggested for him not to do it again.  I do the basic car wash because the times that I have upgraded to a better wash, they've done the exact same job as before! SO DO NOT PAY TO UPGRADE. THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING MORE THAN WHAT THEY DO WITH THE BASIC CAR WASH. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.\",\n",

The facilities are nicer than most which is always a nice factor in your decision to pay for a car wash. I usually get the top end car wash, hand wax and interior protection option. They usually will drop this wash down to $46 if you ask which is more than a ten dollar savings. I don't recommend going on a Saturday morning because it is very busy and they end up taking over an hour to compete the wash. \\nThe wash itself is pretty good but I recommend checking your car thoroughly before you drive away because in my case they are very good at the obvious but not the best at the finer details inside the car. I have had to ask to have my windows redone due to a few small smears on the front and rear. They also seem to forget about the cup holders in both cars they wipe them but don't really clean them and that goes for all the small areas inside your car.   Overall good and the hand wax for under $50 makes this spot a must try!!!\",\n",

The next morning, on the way to the event, the truck overheated 5 minutes after hitting the road. Pulled into a gas station and watched all of the radiator fluid pour out. \n",
      "\n",
      "No big deal. I was early. Trucks break down and you can't necessarily control it. I tried to call the store but kept getting forwarded to the 1-800 dispatch number. Must have called 15-20 times trying to get someone. Each time I reached someone at dispatch, I was put on hold, disconnected a number of times, and ultimately never got anywhere through them despite having my case \"escalated\" and getting forwarded to someone who was supposed to be able to help me. U-Haul's dispatch never was able to reach anyone in the store. \n",

      "After 3 hours in 20 degree weather and no contact, I called my wife and had her go to the store to talk to someone in person. The store refused to send me a new truck until they could send a third-party repair/tow service to inspect mine. Apparently, it's company policy. However, the store is only a 2-3 miles from where the truck broke down. I explained that if I didn't get a new truck, I would miss my event. I even told them to just charge me for another truck and bring it. If they determined that they were not at fault, we could debate that later. No luck. \n",
      "\n",
      "Third party service arrived and was helpful. The first thing the technician told me after popping the hood and taking a quick look was that the truck appeared not to have been serviced in some time, and it never should have been let out of the lot in the condition it was in. He also suggested I use a competitor (won't mention their name here). \n",
      "\n",
      "During the technician's review, the employees at the store confirmed for my wife that the truck never should have been off the lot and was apparently flagged as damaged. They told her it was the fault of the employee who originally helped me the day before and that it was his mess to fix. After keeping her cool and with some patience, my wife was able to convince them to send a new truck to me. \n",

It arrived 30 minutes later, and I transferred all of the gear from one truck to the other and was off. Had to cancel the event and return all of the stuff in the truck back to where I got it. A day completely lost. \n",

      "Charges for the second truck were waived, but the first truck was still charged to my account. My office assistant followed up with the store on 2-3 occasions to get the charge dismissed, citing that the store knowingly let out a bad truck. She was given the name of an individual, who was supposed to call her and arrange the credit. \n",

      "It's now over a month since we rented the truck, and no credit from the store. I've called AMEX to dispute the charges. \n",

      "Admittedly, service from the gentleman who assisted me the first night was cheery and relatively quick. Unfortunately, he either made a mistake or proper measures were not taken to make sure the bad truck was not leased. The assistance from the employees the morning of my issue was abysmal. They were lazy, unresponsive and unmoved by our pleas for help, despite our treating them with kid gloves. Based on their dispositions, we knew any animosity would only make them move more slowly, although I don't know how that is possible. \n",

      "\" CAUTION!!!!!! DO NOT GO HERE!!!! If I could I'd give this place a -5 star!!! That's the first red flag u should know. I have a long story & from reading ALOT of reviews id say about 98% of them r poor reviews about this place. About 5 of them r very similar to mine. So here's my horrible story and experience...It was last month in Oct of 2015 ,I've been hearing about the Tent sale on 83rd between Bell rd & T-bird. Sale started Oct 22nd. So I have a 2014 Crystler 200 & it was my first car I've owned, by this time I had it for about 7 months. My heart was set on a Kia Optima but ended up settling for the 200. So when we get there we are given a person to take us around to look at cars. We were with 2 guys, Brian & Tavo from Vans Chevy. Before I go on, Tavo is an amazing nice guy that is very honest, very helpful so I have nothing bad to say about Tavo. Anyways, Brian shows me a few white optimas but eventually I see a black one w/ black rims, pretty much wanted it . I test drove it & all. Sat down & we negotiated a lot mainly on payments. I wanted 0 down & $350/month. I wanted 0 down because I did not have anything to put down but my trade in & had to make my payment for my 200 on Oct 27th of $330. Brian told me after all the negotiations, ok how about u put down $330 of the payment u were gonna do for the 200 & I said, R u sure I can do that since I have to make that payment for my 200? He said yes, once you sign over the 200 to us you don't have to make payments to them. So I believed him & ended up doing $375/month for the Kia, which we financed with Sammy. Brian also stated that my credit score was great. So I had a good feeling no need for a cosigner which I didn't have for my 200. We swapped keys & the Kia was mine ! I finally felt like I was complete with the car I've been wanting and it was perfect for our baby on the way! About a week goes by & Sammy calls letting me know about the banks he's seeing which one will take the loan. In the mean time my credit union calls me a day after my payment for the 200 was due asking for the payment so I told them,car is not in my possession I traded it in & Brian told me I don't need to pay for this month. The credit union guy tells me that I'm still responsible for my loan payment until they do the pay off. I told him no that's not how it works & they told me diff,I don't have to pay u guys it's not in my possession. About a week & a half goes by & Sammy is asking if I have a cosigner. I say no. Try the TruWest bank my 200 is through.They accepted me. After almost two weeks I try calling & calling his number to speak with Sammy. I can't get through and I leave messages to the front desk to have him call me back . Days go by-nothing. I even call over there while I'm at work to see if he called the credit union, supposedly he said he did but I doubt he did cuz when I spoke w/ credit union they have no notes or record of them calling.\n",
      "I'm getting really impatient by now & it's taking longer than it should . I keep calling & finally speak w/ Sammy & he said we still \"need\" a cosigner to do this deal so I give him my fiancés info & I know for sure they could check if he qualifies in no less than 5 min. It took him another week & a half to tell me he wasn't approved either. I felt like he kept us in the dark & this whole time I'm still wondering if the Kia is going to be mine. At this time it's almost been 3 weeks of attempting phone calls to him. The girl just says he's with customers and I tell her to have him call me back & he doesn't for days.Credit union calls me letting me know that I'm being put into collections cuz of how late my payment is. We decide to drive all the way over there on nov 20th to see what is actually going on & we drove 20miles to speak w/ the finance manager. I told him the situation & said its been pretty Much a month & your finance guy hasn't pushed anything through. He was shocked,but I'm sure this isn't the first time . He had us sit & wait for a sales manager to help us. We sit & wait & wait, 40 min we are still waiting & I'm pissed so we just left back home. I called the next day to speak with the general manager & the lady said he was in a meeting and I asked how long,she said 2 hours. I said ok I'll call back but I just called back & left my name and number & said its really urgent and regarded Sammy w/ finance.Not even 30 min passed & GM called me. I told him my situation & he was very rude. I said you get all the paper work done Today cuz I'm getting my 200 tomorrow! He Didn't apologize & just said,So u are coming in tomorrow? I said Yes. He just bluntly said,Ok see u tomorrow. We get there & see Tavo. I told him I'm here to get my 200. He was shocked cuz he told us that the guys were just passing my file around not getting it done.they told Tavo to stay out of it & he's they one who was pushing it to get done. Overall I got my 200 back&Brian&Sammy didn't come out to like scared liars&cheaters! Never go here! Dont get anything done! \"\n",
